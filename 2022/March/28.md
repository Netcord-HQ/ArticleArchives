What is a Staff Application form?
=================================

A staff application or a moderator application form is basically a job application that you can fill in a Discord server. Management of said server will then go through your submission and decide whether to add you in the Moderation team.

This is something almost every community server of any size does. And yet, there is no official way to make a Staff App form that is approved by Discord.

Why do you need a staff application form?
=========================================

Discord is a platform with over 300 million users all around the world. There are servers dedicated to almost anything all around this platform. Moderators can help you make your community safe and clean to everyone. If you need a strong moderation team for your Discord server, you need to find the most trustworthy people within your server. Someone that is deserving of that honor. Someone that you know will not abuse their permissions.

You can never really trust anyone on the internet. So, finding a good staff team is harder than it looks. Giving someone moderation permissions is not a safe thing for your community at all. When you're choosing your community staff team, you can use a staff application form. Which users in your server can apply to.

Where do I make it?

[Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms) is what everyone uses and it really has everything you'd need from a form builder. It's free, lots of question types, customizable. I like how no feature is locked behind a paywall.

What type of questions do I need to ask?
========================================

Here are some of the most important questions that you need to ask in your staff application form. There are 3 categories of questions.

Contact Information
-------------------

Without any basic idea of the person that you're going to select, you can't trust. To do that, you need to ask him some basic questions about contacting him in Discord. Here are some of the questions under the "Contact Information" category.

-   What is your username?
-   What is your User ID?
-   How old are you?
-   What is your local time zone?
-   When can you moderate during the day?
-   These questions will help you with getting some basic information about the person.

Moderation & Leadership Experience
----------------------------------

In this category of questions, you can find the servers that the user moderated before and some more information about his/her previous moderation experience. Here are some of the questions.

-   Let's us know about you moderation and leadership experience
-   What is the number one reason you decided to apply for staff?
-   What is the responsibility of a moderator?
-   Why should we need to choose you?
-   Please list the Discord servers you have managed/moderated before.

From some questions like these, is it obvious that you can get a 90% idea about his moderation experience, what he/she is going to do as a moderator.

Moderation & Leadership Exam
----------------------------

This is the hardest part of the application. In this category of questions, you can give some scenarios to the applicant. That way you can get a better idea about how he/she is going to act in emergency time. Just make sure to make these questions are,

- Random\
- Related to your Discord community

There you go! There are so many main features and questions that you can add as long as there are related to your server. Make sure that everything is stetted perfectly and looks easy to others. This definitely helps you with finding a good and safe moderation team for your server.
