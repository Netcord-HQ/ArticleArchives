This new Discord Server feature let’s you create a website in 5 minutes
=======================================================================

What’s something your community server lacks? That’s right, a public website.

Sure, websites like [Disboard](https://disboard.org/) and [top.gg](https://top.gg/servers) opens a whole new world for your Discord server to be in. It let’s you be discovered. But with this new Discord update, users will be able to create and publish a personal website made just for their server. Keep reading, you definitely don’t want to miss out on this.

Discord Server Web Page Example

What is a Server Web Page?
==========================

According to Discord’s latest blog update;

> “A Server Web Page is a web page that a Discord server owner can set up to attract, educate, and engage new community members. New community members will be able to join the server directly from this web page.”

For now this feature is slowly rolling out to a small number of servers that have discovery enabled. And it **does not** have any boost requirements either. From a personal stand point, there is no way Discord is going to make this feature entirely free. I believe they’re going to limit _some_ features exclusive to a boost level requirement.

These websites will be indexed by search engines, meaning that you’ll be able to literally Google your Discord server. These web pages will be public. Anyone will be able to view them, in anytime, and from anywhere.

How can I customize the website?
================================

It’s as simple as going to your server settings and clicking Discovery Landing page. A couple of Reddit users have already gotten access to this revolutionary feature. Here’s how the settings look.

Okay but what does the actual web page look like?
-------------------------------------------------

It’s not anything super robust or fully customizable. But we seem to get a quite a few options — which are quite nice in my opinion.

We get a header, the server icon, description, creation date, social links, and everything.

What’s interesting is the category section. We already have two place to describe the server, but a category section? It’s probably more than just a descriptive tag. Many users are suspecting the hint of an external server listing feature. Like the sites mentioned before.

Discord is always evolving into something so much bigger than what we’d expect. It’s always fun to see what new features Discord will bless us, server owners, with next. I am interested in what you think about this new feature. Make sure to drop a few claps below and comment your thoughts — see you tomorrow.
