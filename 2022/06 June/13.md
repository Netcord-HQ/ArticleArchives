Third Tier of Nitro: Discord Nitro Lite $3— might be coming. Here’s what you should know.
=========================================================================================

After years of the two same tiers of Nitro regular and Nitro classic, we may finally have the option of purchasing an even lower tier of Nitro with even lower perks that costs even lower.

And finally, the new tier will include:

Discord Nitro Lite — $2.99/month
--------------------------------

*   **Custom emoji across servers**
*   **Larger file upload**

Yes, those are the only perks of it. Which honestly makes a lot of sense on second thought. Discord Nitro classic exists because people still buy it. And Discord probably noticed that not a lot of people use all of the perks.

Perhaps lowering the price & perks and introducing a lower tier might help more people afford the experience of Nitro and the most used perks.

How ever, we don’t have the answer to whether this is **going to include the profile badge**.

Either way, I think this will open new doors to Nitro buyers and those that don’t really care for features like 1080p or up to 4k source streaming.

This way, not only you are getting what you want, but you are getting that without paying for features you won’t use.

Perhaps a feature selection system?
-----------------------------------

Many users on the [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/vb03zd/discord_lite_new_plan_coming_soon_what_do_u_think/) seems to be adding the same suggestion. The suggestion of getting to select the exact features and upgrades we want, depending on which our monthly price will be tailored.

This could be messy, this could give birth to new exploits.

It may change when its out
--------------------------

This is just an experiment and not announced at all. We can see new values and variables in Discord datamining comments. However like most experiments, this could take months or even years before its fully out.

That’s all!
