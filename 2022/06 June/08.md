> NOTE: This bug is now patched meaning it no longer works. This article explains how the bug worked and what it meant.

You know how we are bound to lowercase letters and hyphens (-) for spaces in our text channels on Discord.

Well, not according to this now-patched bug that gave us the pleasure for a couple of hours.

Yes! You could name your channels _anything._ Any characters, UPPERCASE or lowercase, even normal spaces worked! Well until it was removed.

How to add spaces and capital letters to channels in Discord
============================================================

The bug reportedly only worked on the stable version of Discord **android**.

However the changed channel names were visible and synced up with all clients and versions of Discord.

Procedure
---------

It was as simple as typing the name of the channel in whatever format you wanted. Type it out and save it, that’s all you had to do.

Another method to do this in the desktop client was to use a bot to change a channel name. The bot took your input as is, edited the channel for you, and it worked.

Just a bug
==========

This quite interestingly opens some doors to some great doors, however, it’s just a bug. That’s all it is. And like most bugs, it will be patched soon. And all edited channels will go back to the old way.

Either way, this was nice to have. A great conversation starter and gave us the topic for today’s article.

That’s all for today!
