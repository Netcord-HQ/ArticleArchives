There’s too much to handle in a community Discord server. And you can only do so much.

I’ve compiled a list of **5 ways you can improve your Discord server** which you can use to turn your server into an absolute professional entertainment lounge that’s **active, audience retaining,** and **ever-growing**.

> Let’s make sure we’re all on the same page — These tips are for **community** servers only

Ready? Let’s start!

Channel Tips
------------

1\. Remove Emojis & Symbols
===========================

This is my greatest tip to anyone just starting out a **professional** community server. The first step to professionalism is not to clutter your audience’s field of view.

Not to mention, using `#🌈𝖙𝖍𝖊𝖘𝖊-𝖘𝖞𝖒𝖇𝖔𝖑𝖘` and fonts are not picked up by screen readers. People with visionary disabilities will have a hard time in your server.

And is it just me or channels without emojis and symbols look very good when you have unread messages.

See? This looks great. This is supposed to be subjective but trust me when I say, the default font looks the best.

Exclude this point for special channels with pretty symbols — that is an exception I am willing to make.

2\. Uniform Channel Name Length & Sorting
=========================================

Keep channel names short. Make sure the entire channel name is visible no matter the zoom scale or device. Keep the names similar styled to the ones in the category.

Keep the same `type` of channels together. So Announcement channels should not be alternating or mixed up with voice channels. Sort them by either names length, wave pattern (shortest names go in the top and bottom and the longest name channel is in the middle), importance, or alphabetical (not recommended).

Make sure you set them exactly how you want your members to go through them.

3\. Avoid too many channels
===========================

Avoid having too many channels. Keep the general chat fairly ranked high so we don’t have to scroll any more than once to get to it. That will make sure it gets noticed and used.

If you have multiple channels for `server-info`, `server-rules`, `roles-info`, consider merging them into a single channel. More effectively using a custom bot to have a interactive index menu or simple embeds.

4\. Use a Robust Moderation Bot
===============================

Are you using MEE6 for moderation? You will not believe how robust some moderation bots are and how much they can help you and your moderation team in your case management.

Some absolutely great moderation bots are [Sapphire,](https://sapph.xyz/) [Autajja,](https://auttaja.io/) and [Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.gg/) (Private bot).

It may not be as user-friendly for new Discord users but learn it. It’s going to be worth it totally.

5\. Consistent Identity & Assets
================================

Design or get someone to design custom icons for your server. Not the generic assets like server icon and banner. I mean the custom role icons (if you have enough boosts), the channel topics, and custom emojis.

It’s a great way to add professionalism to your server with consistent icons and its going to look a thousand times better than using assets from google.

Simply get some free stock icons and add your twist to it. It can be as simple as adding a color-overlay or gradient to match your server theme.

How to make server assets, can be a topic for another day but here are some other articles you might be interested in.
