==============================================================

Facebook group chats are being revamped ‘to look like [Discord](http://discord.com) and [Guilded](http://guilded.gg)’. Users from both platforms are at argument whether Facebook ripped off, Discord’s style. Or is there more depth to the “Discord style”, let’s learn all about it.

On 28th June, 2022, Facebook [released an article](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/06/features-to-find-and-connect-with-facebook-groups/) stating the changes that will be coming to Facebook group chats. In case you’re unaware, Facebook, owned by [**Meta Platforms, inc**](http://meta.com). is the largest social network on the internet.

Moving back to the article, they specified some “takeaway” points that should not be left unread.

> We’re also introducing **channels**, which are focused spaces for people to connect in smaller, more casual settings within their communities.

Like Discord, Facebook will be including “channels” in their group chats, making it similar to the style of Discord servers.

Discord servers are a virtual space for communities to communicate with each other in different spaces known as channels. These channels can be text, voice, or stage channels primarily on Discord.

From Facebook’s [promotional video](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/06/features-to-find-and-connect-with-facebook-groups/) on this update, it is also shared that there will be specific features to communicate in voice with group members.

Let’s talk similarities
=======================

These Facebook groups allegedly have similarities with Discord’s Servers. However, with minor UI differences. It is then noticeably clear on the channels format. A side docker with a list of available channels in the community — sounds Discord right?

To be fair, Facebook also kept true to _their_ style. The messages are bubbles and not anything like Discord. Aside from the typical text and audio channels, Facebook also added (or kept) the feed feature.

A special type of channel where group members are able to post anything like they normally would on their Facebook profiles. The only difference being that these posts are limit for the group members to view.

Discord, on the other hand, is also working on such a feature. If you are interested in reading more about it, [click here](/forum-channels-on-discord-everything-you-need-to-know-570e7ab18fc4).

Is this style exclusive to Discord?
===================================

Certainly not, but Discord is seemed to have the biggest slice of the cake. Discord is the most popular VOIP platform right now.

[Slack](http://slack.com), released in 2013, is one of the platforms that might have inspired [Discord](http://discord.com), released in 2015. Both apps are visually similar and share similar features. Including the “Discord-styled” channel system in servers.

However, Slack is made for co-workers in a business whereas Discord, originaly made specifically for gamers, is more commonly used by the general audience, content creators, and communities.

That’s all for today?
---------------------

Was this Facebook’s lack of originality or a smart move in terms of business?
