Forums
======

The sixth type of channels to ever be added to Discord and one of the most anticipated features.

From Muatex#0001

These are special forum channels where anyone can make a “post” and users can comment on the posts with their content making it the perfect environment for systems like suggestion channels, feedback channels, and general-question support channels.

These channels will feature an exclusive OP badge to the person that made the post. This badge will only be visible in the post, nowhere else.

It is still under development and only a very small number of communities have access to it. We look forward to getting to experience the settings in the back-end and implement it in our communities.

Home — Community Home Channel
=============================

Not exactly a channel but one of the prettiest things communities will have in a couple of months.

A Home channel is not a channel but an upcoming default integration to community servers.

This “Home” surface will have segmented information about the community and its recent activity. It will also feature a built in server member counter in the top right. Surprisingly, this is the first member-count built into Discord in public view in the desktop client.

Content Moderator — Built-in auto mod message filter
====================================================

Built in message filter that moderates your channels in the most advanced way possible.

Long gone are the days we used bots to filter unwanted messages in our servers. However, there was a small issue with using bots. The messages are deleted _after_ they are sent. Of course this is their limitation; the message is what triggers the event. Bots cannot detect a word before it is sent.

However with the new built in content moderator system, the messages containing certain keywords can be blocked from being sent entirely.

This feature is currently on the beta roll out to a moderate amount of servers and should be available to all servers shortly.
