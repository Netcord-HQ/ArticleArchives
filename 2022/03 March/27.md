New Platform; New Audience
==========================

Who said your community has to limit itself to Discord? You'll open your community to an entirely new audience with a twitter account if you just know how to do it right.

Let's say your community is based around... Donuts? Yeah, donuts. The fact that there are people who like donuts on Twitter and they have 0 idea about the existence of your server is something you can't ignore. You can (and should) advertise it to them. Let it be known to the donut likers that a server based around their purpose, exists.

How do I promote my Discord's Twitter?
======================================

Now there are a lot of ways to promote your server on Twitter, here are my favorites:

-   Be consistent as f**k. Tweet every single day, multiple times a day even. And be sure to be active in the replies of popular accounts under your niche. This might seem like extra work, but if you don't promote your server, it will never get the attention it deserves.
-   Utilize what you have. Have a catching short & sweet description of your server in the bio. And obviously put the link in clear sight. Bonus point if you have a vanity URL in your server ;)
-   Specify that you are a "Discord Server" so potential users don't mistake it for an organization or anything else.

Accessibility
=============

Another reason. You probably already have ban appeals in your server right? Even if users were DMed the ban appeal link you should still have an external link easily accessible to everyone. Why? Because banning a user removes the user from ever participating in it in any way. So, unless you have a website, twitter is a great way to provide support to users that cannot access the server.

Is it worth the extra work?
===========================

It's honestly up to you, your server's niche, your community, and the amount of time available to you. Other than time, it isn't really costing you anything else. And why does it have to be only you? Get your staff team on tools like [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) so they can tweet and reply from the server's account.

That's it --- thanks!
