Twemoji
-------

Discord utilizes the emoji set made by Twitter called Twemoji for their platform. This set of emojis is Open Source and free to use for anyone and is timely updated according to the new Unicode releases of emojis.

On March 31st, Twitter announced the release of Twemoji v14.0.0 which had started rolling out to users. In this new update we can see new emojis like melting face, saluting face, happy tears, biting lip, nest with and without eggs, and most surprisingly – a pregnant man. Have fun using all of them!

The official GitHub repository for Twemoji by Twitter can be viewed here:

Visualizing Twemojis

Discord is one of the platforms along with Twitter (obviously) to utilize the open source Twemoji set of emojis.

New emojis from Unicode
-----------------------

Unicode, formally The Unicode Standard is an information technology standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems.

Basically, Unicode updates and approvals are the ones to decide which characters or emojis are registered in our devices. For example, the new update from Unicode 14 back in September last year, we were introduced to the emojis we are seeing on Twemoji today.

It seems that WhatsApp has went ahead and already integrated the new emojis for their platform. You can send the new emojis in WhatsApp through your phone, web app, or desktop application right away. However, native Android is yet to introduce us to the Unicode 14 emojis. And so is our PCs.

But hey, now you can send your pregnant man emojis in Discord at least.
