Discord RPC
-----------

Discord RPC is a freely available app, downloadable from GitHub. The download process couldn't be simpler too!

Once you've navigated to [https://github.com/lolitee/adobe-discord-rpc](https://github.com/lolitee/adobe-discord-rpc), simply click on **Adobe Discord RPC** on the right hand side under `Releases`

Once you are on that page, scroll to the bottom and click `discord.rpc.zip`

Once you have downloaded the .zip folder, that's it, you're done! The app doesn't need set up; once the files, code and data are saved on your computer, it will automatically work!

Open up an Adobe app, such as Photoshop, and bask in the glory of flexing your creative juices on your friends!

Troubleshooting Guide: Fixing Common Issues
-------------------------------------------

1\. If the RPC is not working, you might be using the older version of Adobe Suite. This RPC program only supports the Adobe suite (CC 2018 and above).

2\. You might be using a cracked/pirated version of the Adobe Suite.

3\. If the extension doesn't show up in `Window > Extensions`, then re-check if `PlayerDebugMode` is set to `1` in Registry Editor

4\. If you try these debug methods but to no avail, try removing the files and redownloading the software as an error may have occured during the download process.

If **nothing above** works, then there's most likely an issue on Adobe's side, most likely that your app is outdated or the extension itself is broken. I recommend updating your app.

Steps to Disable/Uninstall
--------------------------

Should you decide that you no longer wish to use Discord RPC, follow the steps listed below to uninstall the program:  
1\. Open an Adobe program (such as Photoshop).  
2\. Navigate to Window > Extensions > Discord Rich Presence  
3\. Toggle the "enabled" setting to **off**  
4\. Restart the program.  
5\. After restarting, see if the rich presence is still there.

Alternatively, if you remember where you saved the folder when downloading, you can just delete the file and it will remove all the data required for Discord RPC to work, hence stopping the automated rich presence.

> **Note**: This works only on the official version of Adobe Suite Apps. It does not support (neither do we) any cracked or pirated version of the software.
