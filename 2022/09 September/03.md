> Discord has rolled out a new feature that allows users to receive notifications only for the “highlights” of each server they are in.

If you're anything like me, you're constantly forgetting to check important channels in Discord. Whether it's #announcements or that one server you're in where everyone is talking about the latest episode of your favourite show, it's easy to miss important messages. That's why I was excited to hear about Discord's new Highlights feature.

Now, with Highlights, you can get notifications for important messages in any channel, even if you have your server notifications turned off. This is a great way to make sure you never miss an important message again. In this article, I'll show you everything you need to know about Discord's new Highlights feature, including how to turn it on and how to use it to your advantage.

Highlights Notifications
------------------------

Discord has rolled out a new feature that allows users to receive notifications only for the “highlights” of each server they are in. This feature is opt-in, meaning that it is not automatically turned on for users, and it can be turned on or off in each server.

The Highlights setting is an additional toggle you can turn on or off in each server. It is located in your server notification settings. This setting operates independently of your server notification settings (all messages, @mentions only, or nothing). For example, you can have your server notifications settings set to Nothing and still receive Highlights notifications if the toggle is on.

What is included in Highlights?
-------------------------------

Highlights lets you know what’s happening in the servers you care about. This includes things like popular posts, events, friend activity, new forums, and more.

The information that Discord uses to determine if something is considered a Highlight might depend on some personal data, along with details about the server or channel. Discord relies on information such as how often you visit a server, the number of reactions to a post, or the number of attendees at an event in a server.

At any point in time, you may choose to turn on or off personal data for Discord via the personalisation toggle in your ****Privacy & Safety settings**.**

Personalisation data is used to make your specific Discord experience better for you.
