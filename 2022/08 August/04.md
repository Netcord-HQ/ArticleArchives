Unless you've been living under a rock, you may or may not have heard of DALL-E. You may have also seen AI generated art floating around all over the internet.

It is the most advanced Artificial Intelligence image-generation algorithm of all time. It is capable of generating beautiful, high res, images from one single prompt. Anything you can type, this AI can make an image of.

It is unreal to think that the image above were never hand-drawn or digitally painted. They were generated. Mere pixels are all they are.

### But how does Discord connect to this?

The real DALL-E project is not available to the public. For obvious reasons. However, a public mini version of DALL-E 2 called DALL-E _mini_ [is available to be used at any point](https://www.craiyon.com/).

Everyone who has used DALLE-E mini version knows how slow (2 minutes to generate) it is because of how popular it is. Thousands of users are constantly using the project all at once and it slows the process.

Another independent project, however, is on the rise. And, good news, it functions through a **Discord bot**.

Midjourney
----------

> Midjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

> We are a small self-funded team focused on design, human infrastructure, and AI. We have 11 full-time staff and an incredible set of advisors.

Midjourney is the bridge between the public and AI generated art. It can generate beautiful pieces of art with a single prompt. You can try Midjourney for **free** right now. Let me show you how.

### Step 1: Join Midjourney Beta

Don't worry, there is no waitlist you have to wait forever. Simply head over to [**midjourney.com**](https://midjourney.com) and click "Join the beta" button.

It should take you to their Discord server. Make a Discord account if you don't have one already.

### Step 2: /imagine

Find any `# newbies-x` channel in the 'Newcomer Rooms' channel within the Discord server. Then you can simply time the following command:

> /imagine

You will be asked to put in your prompt in the next argument.

### Step 3: Wait.

Here's my prompt and my best attempt to generate the Netcord's site background

It didn't quite get what I was trying to explain but I blame myself. This is insane.

Second prompt. These would make pretty cool profile pics.

You are presented with 4 different generations each time you run the command. It barely takes a minute to generate. From here, you have the options to upscale each one of them using the `U` buttons. And also, you can generate variations of a particular one of the four using the `V` buttons.

If you don't like any of the generations you can also ask the bot to regenerate the entire prompt using the üîÅ button.

Midjourney isn't entirely free. You only have a limited amount of commands you can run with the bot. You can have a maximum of 25 runs for free. For more commands, you need to purchase their premium plans.

### This is scary and interesting at the same time

Many would argue Artificial Intelligence was never supposed to get this far ahead. It would only get destructive from here. Whereas some others, more optimistic people, would argue that this is the new age of content.
