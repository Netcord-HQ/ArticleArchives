Heroku is a cloud platform that allows you to deploy your Discord bot without having to worry about hosting or server costs. It's easy to set up and you can have your bot running in minutes. So if you're looking for a way to keep your bot online without spending a lot of money, Heroku is a great option. Of course, there are some downsides to using Heroku. The biggest one is that Heroku will put your bot to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.

Personal accounts are given a base of 550 free dyno hours each month. In addition to these base hours, if you verify with your credit card you get a 450 additional hours.

With Heroku, you can get your bot up and running in no time, and you can be sure that it will be able to handle any traffic you throw at it. Plus, Heroku offers a wide range of tools and resources that you can use to manage your bot and keep it running smoothly.

Replit ¬†
--------

Replit is a simple, yet powerful, online IDE that makes it easy to create and host your Discord bot. All you need is a Replit account and a bit of code.setting up and running your Discord bot on Replit is a simple process that only takes a few minutes. Once you have your Replit account set up, you can get started by creating a new project and adding your Discord bot code.

> Pro Tip : You can use Uptimerobot to make your add your project as a monitor to make it run 24/7

Raspberry PI
------------

A Raspberry Pi is a ‚Äúminiature computer‚Äù ‚Äî and that‚Äôs right, you can host your own Discord bot from your own R-Pi and have it up and running 24/7 (as long as you don‚Äôt lose power!)

As of the time this guide was written, the latest version of the R-Pi available on the market was 4.0, but you can still find older Raspberry Pi versions for sale on the web.

****Note: Your Raspberry Pi can be a very reliable Discord bot host, but it only goes so far as you‚Äôre able to keep it up and running. If you have a bot used by lots of different servers, your R-Pi may struggle to keep up with memory/resources. This is why we still recommend [hosting your own Discord bot on a VPS](https://pixelnest.cloud/hosting/discord).****

Self Hosting
------------

This is the ultimate __free__ hosting option ‚Äî running your Discord bot from your very own computer.

Of course, this will only work well if you (1) Have your computer up and running 24/7 without going into sleep mode and (2) Have a fast internet connection to handle API requests to your Discord bot.

Fortunately, hosting on your own computer is __extremely__ simple.

All you have to do is install your code runtime environment (whether that‚Äôs Node.js, Python, Java, etc.), and then run your bot‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it.

Once your bot is running it‚Äôll connect to and communicate with the Discord API, and run as it normally should.

If you‚Äôre just getting started with Discord bots, this is a great way to test your bot and make sure it‚Äôs working correctly.

Final thoughts
--------------

Free hosting servers are slow and sluggish compared to paid servers. The key to robust and reliable hosting of your bot is using a reputable and reputable third-party hosting provider.

We recommend [Pixelnest](https://pixelnest.cloud/) because of its reliability, stable uptime, and low cost (also them being our partner üòâ). Use code **netcord** at checkout for a flat 15% discount.

A good hosting provider will allow you to:

*   **Reliable Uptime**
*   **Simple Control Panel**
*   **DDoS Protection** ‚Äì As your server/bot becomes more popular, third parties may try to bring it down with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Luckily, [Pixelnest](https://pixelnest.cloud/) servers give you the option to add DDoS protection if needed.
*   **Reliable Operating System**
*   **Frequent Backups** ‚Äì If something happens and you lose your data, backups can help. A reliable hosting provider offers backup options and ¬†easy restore mechanisms.
*   **Reliable Support Team** ‚Äì If you have any questions about ¬†Discord bot hosting servers, the support team will save you from the endless headaches and confusion of trying to find the answers yourself. Usually, ¬†you can get prompt help by simply submitting a support ticket.
