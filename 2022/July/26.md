This feature is slowly rolling out to all Xbox users. Right now, you can try out the new Discord voice calls on Xbox only if you're a member of Xbox Insiders Alpha testing program. It will be available for you to test if you qualify in the upcoming weeks and finally, it will be available to all Xbox users in the upcoming few months.

How to Use Discord on Xbox
==========================

Here's exactly how you can use Discord on Xbox.

Connect Your Xbox Account to Discord
------------------------------------

Connect your Xbox account by going to User settings > Connections > click on the Xbox logo. Follow the prompts and you are all set.

According to Discord, if you had connected the accounts before, you will need to connect them again to override the permissions and enable the new features!

This connection allows Discord to show your Xbox gamertag, your game activity, and how long you've been playing it for in your Discord profile.

Transfer Audio Call
-------------------

You will need the Xbox mobile app to transfer your ongoing calls to your Xbox console.

### Text Messages Aren't Supported
