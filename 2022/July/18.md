Discord is a text, voice, and video communication platform. It is the leading tool and platform to build your community.

In this article, I'll show you how you can download any asset from Discord. This includes assets like someone's profile picture, profile banner, and also server icons and banners. Basically any image or SVG icon you see in the UI, can be saved to your hard drive on your computer.

How to download a profile picture from Discord
----------------------------------------------

You can natively download the profile picture of a Discord user directly through Discord and here's how.

#### Open Discord on your web browser

This step is necessary for us to be able to access the Inspect Element feature. You can skip this step if you are using Discord Canary. For this tutorial I will be showing the process on Chrome. But the process should be pretty much the same for all browsers.

#### Open 'inspect element' tools with ctrl + shift + i

You will see this hard-to-miss warning on the console tab. Read it if it's your first time seeing it. Don't worry I will not ask you to copy-paste any string of code injection in the console. Next, follow my steps:

### Find the "Sources" tab, click it.

### If you are on the sub-tab of "Filesystem", click on Page, to go to the Page tab.

### Expand cdn.discordapp.com from the dropdown.

There you will find all the loaded assets in your Discord client at this time. You will find folders like **avatars, banners/SERVER\_ID, emojis, icons, role-icons, etc.** All sorted by their IDs.

### Once you've found your asset, there should be a small image in the tab beside. Right click -> open image in new tab.

You may notice that the image is pretty small. Don't worry, we can get the file in the highest possible quality.

### Change the integer at the end of the url to the highest power of 2 possible.

In this case, initially the number is 32 which is 2 raised to the power of 5. That means, I can change the number to 2 raised to the power of 6, i.e. 64, to get a higher quality image.

Any number that is not a power of 2, will fail to load the image. To get the maximum quality, try changing the number to 512, 1024, 2048.

Once you've pointed to your desired element, it will highlight an SVG tag in the page. Right click it, and select Edit as HTML.

Click CTRL + A and then CTRL + C.

### Create a new .txt document anywhere on your PC and open it.

### Paste your code in the document. Then the file as the following:  
1\. Set the type as "All files (\*.\*)"

### 2\. Make sure your file name ends with .svg

### Open the .svg file in any photo editing software and you have yourself a Discord UI icon in SVG file format.
