Ever heard of the name “Phibi” in Discord? Yeah, she’s a frog character designed by Discord. The purpose of this character (and tens more) is to be used in promotional banners, assets, chat mock ups, etc. What’s more, Discord actually released profile pictures of all of these characters that you can set in Discord without ever downloading them.

What Are the Official Discord Profile Pictures?
===============================================

Discord uses a bunch of characters in their promotional videos, in profile mock-ups in their websites, or whenever there is a need to show “a Discord user”. The smart move definitely was to use cute little illustrations, because its really hard to get actual employee head shots — and really unpleasant to look at jeez. As of right now, there are over **140**\+ Discord characters and more coming in as we speak. And mind you, each has its own name.

Where Do I Find Discord Characters?
-----------------------------------

There is an excellent [Figma](http://figma.com) community file, made by [Bred](https://www.figma.com/@Bred) and [Jace](https://www.figma.com/@jace). These profile pictures are in vector format. Which, in case you didn’t know, is a file format specializing in the ability that it does not loose its resolution no matter how much you scale it up or down. Making them the perfect file format for logos, website content, and character designs.
