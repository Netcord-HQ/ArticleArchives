Discord Voice Activities are special integrations made to Discord voice channels in which you can use special integration apps and games to participate in with VC members. Apps like YouTube in the 'Watch Together' activity and games like Poker are just a few examples.

In addition to this, Discord has finally released an entirely new game called 'Know What I Meme?' and today, you're going to learn all about it. This is the 14th type of voice activity integration made by Discord. And it actually sounds fun.

Know What I Meme?
=================

Know What I Meme is a social party game of GIFs and memes. 8 players can join the fun at a time but anyone can spectate the game. The lets you select a text prompt for the 'meme'. Every player has to go through their built-in GIF finder and find the most relevant and funniest GIF fitting the text prompt. The players will then vote on each other's GIF. The player with the funniest GIF and the highest points will win the game.

The GIF Picker
--------------

The game is integrated with a built-in GIF picker. You can search for, select and send your GIFs without leaving the game.

This of course means you will face some limitations with your GIF responses. Which is definitely for the better.

This integrated GIF picker will prevent you from sending just about any inappropriate GIF. Discord said this in their [official KWIM article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/7552538635031-Know-What-I-Meme-FAQ):

> we may use **certain content filters** so some GIFs may not appear in the search results.
