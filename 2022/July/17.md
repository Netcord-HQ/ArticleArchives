One of the best things about Discord as platform is that it is available to everyone on all devices: mobile, Windows, Mac, Linux, and even web browsers. With multiple devices, it can be a little difficult to manage your Discord sessions.

You probably logged into your Discord account on your Mom's phone and now want to log out of it before she goes through your chats. Or maybe you are just curious how many devices your account is logged in. Perhaps a hacker or an unauthorized login has been made without your consent? In these cases, this "Sessions" feature will come in real handy.

##### Here's what Sessions look like in User Settings.

What is the Sessions Discord Feature?
-------------------------------------

This new Sessions feature will allow you to manage your current and other Discord login/activity sessions. This is where all the devices that your account is logged in in will show. It shows your current session, the device you're seeing this page in, and other sessions with all the other devices.

You have the option to Log Out of Session directly through this page. It shows the IP address of the devices and the last logged in stat. You also have a button you can click to log out of all other sessions at once.

#### What if an unauthorized user logs me out?

It probably needs your 2FA authentication via code to perform a logout.

What to do when you see an unrecognized device?
-----------------------------------------------

If you see a device here that you do not recognize, here's what you should do. First, log out of that session. Then change your password immediately so that whoever accessed your account with password can no longer login because the password is changed. If they logged in with your account token, changing the password will reset your token so they can't access your account this way either. Stay safe!

As this feature is very early in development, we cannot expect anything from the screenshots. However, since this is not a big feature it should stay pretty much the same. Either way, this is going to be very useful for all Discord users. Most of the platforms have had this feature since day 1, it's a shame we're only getting this now. Better late than never!
