A strange link of a .webm video has started to get a lot more traction over the past few hours. It is the link of a video where, as seen on Discord, it shrinks vertically over the course of it's duration.

When you press play, the video starts and gets smaller and smaller, changing its resolution dynamically. The length of the video is about 15 seconds and let me warn you, you aren't able to pause it until it's over.

**You can try this out by yourself by using this this link:**

**Simply copy and paste it in your Discord server, click play and you are good to go.**

Because of the way Discord spacing works, your entire chat will gradually come down as the video is being played. Which is very weird to see, in my opinion.

Explanation
===========

In this section I will attempt to explain this weird phenomenon. Keep in mind that I did my personal research on this topic and I am not a professional in file formats, video encoding, or file format scripting.

It's the File Format : WebM
---------------------------

> WebM is an open, royalty-free, media file format designed for the web.

> WebM defines the file container structure, video and audio formats. WebM files consist of video streams compressed with the VP8 or VP9 video codecs and audio streams compressed with the [Vorbis](https://xiph.org/vorbis/) or [Opus](https://www.opus-codec.org/) audio codecs.

In simple terms, it's a file format created by Google. Yes that is correct, Google. Many digital product creators actually hate this file format. Simply because, it is not supported even in the industry leading software, Premiere Pro. Not without a 3rd party extension at least.

However, there is a wide range of possibility with the .webm video file. Like as seen in the GIF above, it can dynamically change its actual resolution as it plays.

Well not really, of course. But it is possible with a little bit of scripting magic.

Under The Hood
--------------

I have found this video by [LPN64 - Le Lapin Malin](https://www.youtube.com/c/ExtReMLapin) that gives a little idea on how it is possible.

Adding to this, I found [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65692526) in a [StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65500779/constantly-resizing-webm-file) from over a year ago. That's right, this link has been around more for more than a year. These random spurts of traction . It tells us that the trick behind it is rather boring. They said:

"I stopped researching for this question, but recently (and entirely by accident) stumbled over the solution, and it's a bit more boring than one might think. It's not about trickery with file headers or anything, just plain old editing:

*   First the video is chopped into parts. Each of these parts is generated with a different aspect ratio. (This can be done with ffmpeg for example).
*   Then these parts are concatenated together again to form a single video file, with the first part having a aspect ratio of 1:1 to make the file look normal in previews. (Again, ffmpeg has a concat function)
*   Then the audio of the original file (which is lost during the process of chopping the video in parts and concatenating it again) is copied into this new file.

So it's "just" a bunch of videos with different aspect ratios, stitched together."

Also, thanks to the [Reddit post on r/DiscordApp](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/wazl23/weird_video_what_is_this_new_feature/) for bringing this to our attention.
