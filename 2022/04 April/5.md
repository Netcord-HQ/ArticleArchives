The greatest minds on the internet have found a way to automate even the simplest things.

Today I’ve put together a list of the best websites that can help you in your day to day life on Discord as a Server owner or a general user.

Ready? Let’s start!

1\. Discord Resource Wiki
=========================

If you’re looking for, well, basically anything related to Discord, [discordresources.com](https://discordresources.com/wiki) has it all.

It is thee biggest knowledge base for every information corner on Discord. From community-made to even official resources by Discord themselves.

My favorite thing about this site is that the way it is organized. Everything is nicely packed into sections you can jump to at any time.

2\. [auto.creavite.co](https://auto.creavite.co/)
=================================================

Ever wondered how some people got the same fire effect on their profile pics? Well turns out this _hidden gem_ of a website lets you create animated PFPs and banners for free.

If you lack design skills (ouch) but you still want to take advantage of the Nitro perks, you should definitely give this one a try.

You can customize the text of course but you can also customize the tint colors on a bunch of templates. The best thing about this is that **they’re completely free without any watermarks**!

One thing they don’t lack is the availability of templates.

3\. [discord-avatar-maker.app](https://discord-avatar-maker.app/)
=================================================================

This website does exactly what it’s named. You can basically create an avatar with customizations that looks like Clyde. It’s simple to use, pretty customizable, and **free forever.**

Best Feature About this
-----------------------

My personal favorite feature of this website is that I can literally animate an external icon (not Clyde) with some amazing preset animations. Then save it to my computer. Surprisingly, the quality is so good, and the animations are smooth too.

Before I learned digital animation for my icons, this is what I’ve used. And it works like a charm if you’re looking to animate your server logo for cheap ($0.00, that is.)

4\. [coolsymbol.com](https://coolsymbol.com/)
=============================================

Another one of those websites I use all the time. Many of you ask me everyday where I find symbols like ➜, ・ , ‣ , ✚, ┇, for my channels. Well — now you know!

5\. [datetimecord.rauf.wtf](https://datetimecord.rauf.wtf/)
===========================================================

Whenever I’m making announcements for events, it’s good to let everyone know when the event is starting so people can prepare.

**Time zones suck**. Don’t use GMT UTC IST tags in your message, use DateTimeCord. Put in the time in your local time zone, copy paste the formatting in your server — voila!

Hope you learned something new!
