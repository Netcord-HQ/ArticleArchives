Overusing Special Fonts
=======================

New Discord users lean towards a more “cool” look by going with 𝔣𝔬𝔫𝔱𝔰 𝔱𝔥𝔞𝔱 𝔩𝔬𝔬𝔨 𝔩𝔦𝔨𝔢 𝔱𝔥𝔢𝔰𝔢 for their channel names.

What’s more? ᴜsɪɴɢ ᴛᴇxᴛ ᴡɪᴛʜ ғᴏʀᴄᴇᴅ ᴜᴘᴘᴇʀᴄᴀsᴇ for channels because “it looks better” because Discord doesn’t allow spaces and uppercase in #channel-names. Does it actually look good though?

I am not allowed to give my personal opinion but I don’t think it’s easy on the eyes for anyone. Plus you have the risk of your channels showing up as ☒☒☒☒☒☒ for people without newer phones or those using Linux.

You may feel like it being an astronomically small amount of audience to care about but it’s important to forge _their_ first impression about your server nicely.  
I do want to mention that using it for special channels or just some words **for aesthetic reasons is completely okay** and there are many special text converters with great looking fonts.

Overwhelming Information
========================

*   If you want your new members to feel good about your server, you don’t need to bombard them with hundreds of bot DMs with advertisements of your “partners”. Figure out something else. DMing advertisements as soon as you join is a huge turn off for the most of us.
*   Having way too many channels is the perfect way to ruin your first impression for me. If I have to scroll more than once to get to your general chat, I might as well just not bother scrolling then hop into another server.

Complicated Verification
========================

I shouldn’t need to authenticate your Discord bot to my account or go to a website to fill multiple captcha to finally get access to your Discord server. It should be someone powerful and simple and something I can do without leaving Discord.

Limitations for Basic Features
==============================

Slowmode in #general when no one is talking? This is probably why that is. I understand when it’s necessary. When it’s super active and you need to make it easier for your moderators to moderate easily. That’s literally what it’s made for. Other then the scenario I just mentioned, you don’t need slow mode in general in a dead chat.

Having to level up to use external emojis can, in fact, ruin your server’s first impression. Specially when there aren’t many good emojis in your server either.

Limiting basic features behind a paywall/level/or activity is a disaster.

Lack of Originality
===================

When I join a server and see that it has copied materials from my server or any other server I am in, it instantly makes me want to leave the server.

You should try to be as original as possible. With an original server logo, banner, headers, role icons, channel topics, etc.

Final Words
===========

Your member retention matters the most, if not one of the most important analytic you should look for. It’s also an important analytic to get accepted to partnership. Make sure to keep them new members engaged!
