Do you want your server to look cool in the eyes of others? There are multiple possibilities. Some well-known methods are using _attractive_ emojis, fonts, and icons for Discord channels and categories. Sometimes it can be difficult to find the most suitable and compatible emoji and fonts. Here are the ones I recommend.

Just add emoji to channel and category names to make your channel look more engaging than plain text. This can also be set to roles.

Mainly, find relevant emoji for the channel to improve its appearance. GetEmoji is one of the famous websites that you can use to find and copy the exact emoji you need.

You may have noticed that you cannot have CAPS ON on channel names, well with this site, you can! Simply type your text that you want in uppercase and it will generate a small cap font that you can use in your text/voice channels.

In Discord, you can’t add space between text channel names. But adding a symbol between text channel names can look like a space and that make it even cooler. [**Coolsymbol.com**](https://coolsymbol.com/) is one of the best sites that you can use to copy line, dot and any other symbols for your Discord server.

Be careful when using special symbols and fonts
===============================================

> Overusing special/hard to read fonts can **ruin** your server aesthetics. Use them sparingly and keep your server looking clean.
