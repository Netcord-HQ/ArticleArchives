Modmails VS Tickets — let’s settle this once and for all
========================================================

Which one is better? Which one to choose? Make sure you choose the right one.

It’s important for members to contact the moderation team. They sometimes have to, for a lot of reasons. But which path should you choose?

Should you go with:

**_(a) Modmails_**, the system that lets your members DM a bot and contact staff instantly and experience as if they were talking directly with a support agent  
or**_(b) Tickets_** for your members to have a 1on1 conversation with your team _within_ your server?

The competition is real
=======================

There are so many great public bots for both systems. Like [tickettool.xyz](https://tickettool.xyz) and [modmail.xyz](https://modmail.xyz/). I am not going to cover bot features, just the system in general.

Both systems have a similar premise. And it shouldn’t matter much on what you chose. But there has to be some pro’s and con’s right? I’ll cover the cons because the pro’s are all same on both.

Why you shouldn’t use Modmails
==============================

1.  Modmails are a **_much better_** option **if** you are using a custom bot. When you’re using a public bot, the user has to choose which server they want to send the Modmail to.  
      
    And personally, it’s a hassle to scroll through the bot menus to find the server I’m looking for. Because there are just so many servers using the same bot.  
      
    The user is looking for help and support. You should make it quick.
2.  No 1:1 conversation but its better (for mods) for being able to discuss in the support channel because you have to confirm the message you want to send to the person on the DM.
3.  This is a pro for some: **Anonymity of the user can be remained** with this depending on the bot you’re using. Which may be a good case or bad one depending on why they’re contacting the staff.
4.  Many high level, famous Discord accounts have their DMs closed. It might turn them away having to open their DMs just to get some help.

Why you shouldn’t use Tickets
=============================

1.  **No anonymous support at all.** Using a ticket system in your server leaves no way for you to implement 100% anonymity.
2.  This helpdesk for your mods require channels. Which may be a problem if you have too many in your server.
3.  You cannot contact support when you’re timed-out (muted)
4.  If your ticket system doesn’t have a claiming system, it can get quite messy down there for your support team to manage the opened tickets (if there are too many open at one time)

Conclusion
==========

There is no good or bad option. Unless you have a custom bot for support, you should go with a **Ticket** system. But ultimately it’s going to be your decision.

The cons I mentioned above are solely based on my personal experience. I’ve been on Discord for more than 2 years and I’ve used both as a mod and as a user.
