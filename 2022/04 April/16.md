The Dangers of a Custom Discord bot
===================================

Custom bots are a great way to take your server professionalism to the next level, however here’s why you should consider giving it a second thought.

A custom bot is a Discord bot developed by someone specifically for your server. You may have seen custom developed bots on large servers. Have anyone previously offered you a custom bot for your not-so-large (small) server?

Even if the person is agreeing to do it for free, do not accept the offer unless you personally know the type of person they are. I do want to mention that paying a reputed developer for a custom bot in your server is mostly safe.

Use Discord Teams
=================

Most professional bot developers will ask you to make a Discord team. And you definitely should no matter the dev you are working with.

The bot should be owned and made by your account. You can share the details with the dev personally.

Make sure to have access to regenerate the bot token at your fingertips. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, here’s an article for you form writebots.com.

How To Get A Discord Bot Token (Step-by-Step Guide)

Log in to your [**Discord Teams**](https://discord.com/developers/teams) and give the dev access to a Discord team made for your bot. Discord Teams allow the both of you to have access to the bot information.

Choose Perms Wisely
===================

When you invite your custom bot to your server, choose your permissions wisely. If it’s not a moderation bot, there’s no need for it to have ban, kick, timeout, and administrator perms. And neither does the dev.

Have access to the code
-----------------------

Even if you can’t code, ask the dev if you can have access to the bot’s live code at all times. You will surely be able to understand at least some lines. Unless they wrote it in pure binary. _011001110110111101110100011000110110100001100001._

Harm Potential
==============

How much damage can a Discord bot do to your Discord server? If you and your dev are friends but not that close, and you do something that makes him upset here’s what the possibilities are.

If they have access to the token, he can log into the bot through a client and can do anything in your server as an administrator if you’ve given the bot admin perms while inviting. (Banning, creating roles, channels, etc) So keep that in mind.

Final Words
===========

This isn’t always the case. But it’s good to know that in this world, you cannot trust anyone with your property. The eponymous way Discord works, makes it so easy for anyone to have their servers ruined because they were too kind to someone.

You don’t necessarily have to have a custom Discord bot. There are so many out there with great features.

But if you know the dev personally, you’ve been mates for years and you trust them with life, go ahead. Custom bots spice up your Discord server to a next level.

That’s all — stay creative!
