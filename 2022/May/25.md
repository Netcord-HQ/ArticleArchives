Are Content Moderators Paid?
----------------------------

Moderation is a voluntary job for most of the Discord community.

> It entirely depends on the community whether its moderators are paid

For example, a Discord server or a Twitch channel for a product of companies like Google would make sense for it to pay its professionally trained content moderators that are most likely already employees of it.

On the other hand, a server for a small creator just starting out on Discord would not be able to pay its moderators but the community would rather volunteer that time to help our the creator.

What is the job of a Content Moderator?
---------------------------------------

The job of a content moderator on a platform like Twitch or Discord is to filter out unwanted user-generated content from a page, channel, and/or server that is user-run or centralized by the company.

Content moderation is hard. Moderating user generated content involves opening yourself to explicit images and text messages on the daily — based on the size of the community.

Many moderators on Discord and Twitch have reported to have suffered from mental issues with the expose to gore and NSFW media. Many have reported to get “desensitized” to such content.

If I were to pay my moderators, how much should I pay?
------------------------------------------------------

It’s a far more complex question to answer that you might think. I cannot give you an integer.

First, are you sure you want to pay your moderators? There are a lot of people who would be willing to moderate for free. But if you want a professional moderation team, there are agencies you can contact who could give you a number of moderators for your community at a fixed rate.

Second, what would be their pay-rate? Hourly? Weekly? Monthly? Per stream? Also what kind of work would you have them do? Just chat moderation or providing support in tickets to users.

How much do large server pay their moderators?
----------------------------------------------

[**Ninja**](https://www.twitch.tv/ninja), streamer and content creator, pays each his moderators $50 per stream.

It makes sense for him as he earns quite a lot from that medium. It only makes sense to pay back some of the amount he got from donations, subs, and gifts to the people that makes it possible to have a fun time in his chats.

> It’s hard to manage moderators pay

xQc has said to be paying $0 for his Twitch mods.

Since most of us are minors and just doing Discord for fun, it’s not necessary to have paid moderators for small communities.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some content creators I know kind of pay their mods in odd ways which are kind of smart in a way.

[**SoundDrout**](https://www.youtube.com/c/SoundDrout) **—** YouTuber and owner of one of the largest Discord servers, [Sound’s World (300k+)](https://discord.gg/sound) pays his mods giving Discord Nitro to the best performing moderator in his server.

Many others are said to host special giveaways for the moderators to participate in for a higher chance of winning.

Would having a pay for your current mods make them perform better?
