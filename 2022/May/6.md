Did you know that in addition to the stable discord client you’re currently using, there are two more official discord clients?

**Discord’s three official versions are labeled Stable, Beta, and Alpha.2**

1\. Let’s start with the first one **— Discord Stable**
=======================================================

This is the Discord we all know. The majority of users use the stable version of Discord. It is totally open to the public, and you can easily get it from their [official website](https://discord.com/).

2. **Discord Beta**
===================

Public Test Build (PTB) is another name for it. This version is available at [https://discord.com/download](https://discord.com/download); simply scroll down to find it. This version is similar to the stable version, but you may get early access to features before they are officially released. The PTB version generally contains **more bugs than the Stable version**, however this should not prevent you from using it normally.

3. **Discord Canary**
=====================

Discord Alpha, commonly known as Discord Canary, is a very early test build. This version gets features much sooner than the PTB version. It is mostly used by testers to find bugs and loopholes and then report them to developers so that they may be fixed in a stable version. Canary is the **most unstable** of the three and has an orange icon rather than a blurple one. Download links for the Canary and all other clients can be found [_here_](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035675191-Discord-Testing-).
