Self assignable roles have become a necessity in almost all Discord server.

They are the perfect way to let your members customize their experience in your server completely on their own.

Whether it be color roles, ping roles, or pronoun roles, we as server owners have introduced additional personalization features into our communities de-centralized from Discord.

But did you know there are over 5 ways you can have self assignable roles set-up on your server? Let’s go over them one by one to see which one fits your needs.

1\. Reaction Roles
==================

This is the most common and popular method of self assignable roles. It is also the first way people used to do it.

There are bots like [Carl-bot](https://carl.gg/), [Dyno](https://dyno.gg/) and various others that lets you do these with ease. There are also bots made specifically for Reaction Roles like [ReactionRoles](https://top.gg/bot/550613223733329920) Bot by Droplet Development but it isn’t recommended.

2\. Button Roles
================

Button roles are the next upgrade to self roles after reactions. Discord added the feature to let bots and webhooks have “button” which can trigger something in the code or set them to link to a different website.

Button roles is possible with public bots like [Hydra](https://hydra.bot/) & [SlashBot](https://top.gg/bot/788814313930096662).

One of the best pro’s of this is that these can be entirely customizable with a custom Discord bot or [Discohook Utils bot](https://dutils.shay.cat/) (recommended). These look super nice in comparison to Reactions and will keep your server members wanting more.

3\. Dropdown/Menu Roles
=======================

Honestly, these are equally as functional as Buttons.

Although I would probably go for these in terms of Ping roles because there would be a lot of role buttons in the same message. This very good-looking pick-yours menu would be the best option in that case.

It will be a better choice to use both functions for different types of roles in your self roles channel.

To the best of my knowledge, there aren’t any good public bots that lets you do this. So the only way to get something like this would be to use a custom bot which will have its own limitations and extra work.

Other methods
=============

It’s worth mentioning that besides these, there are other ways once could go about making self roles in their server. Ways like _!command_ roles, and _/command_ roles which are not very user friendly.

Whatever system you choose make sure its appropriate and usefull for your community. Do what you think is the easiest for you and what you think is worth is.
