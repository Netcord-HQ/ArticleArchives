What’s the big change?
======================

A new feature is on the roll out with servers being able to upload 5 stickers for free.

This is how it used to be:

*   Level 1 (two boosts) unlocks 15 sticker slots
*   Level 2 (seven boosts) unlocks +15 sticker slots
*   Level 3 (fourteen boosts) unlocks +30 sticker slots

And this is how it’s going to be:
---------------------------------

*   Level 0 (zero boosts) unlocks **5 sticker slots**
*   Level 1 (two boosts) unlocks **+10 sticker slots**
*   Level 2 (seven boosts) unlocks +15 sticker slots
*   Level 3 (fourteen boosts) unlocks +30 sticker slots

In other words, Discord is moving 5 slots from level 1 to default slots. Is this change good? Beneficial in any way? Let’s find out.

What does this mean for an average Discord owner and user?
----------------------------------------------------------

Well first, its free advertising. If you have a public Discord server, you can make use of this “\[emoji\] is from \[your server\]” feature that you can enable.

When people use your public server stickers in other servers, and when someone clicks on the very cool sticker, they will see that it’s from your server and with that, they will be able to join your server directly from that.

So add those beautiful stickers to your server and get at least _some_ inter-server advertising without breaking any ToS.

What are Discord stickers?
--------------------------

Discord stickers are a somewhat new feature Discord added. It’s not to be confused with Discord emojis though. Stickers are larger in visual size and can be either static or animated with a few differences.

> **Support File Formats:** PNG (for static) APNG (for animated)  
> ❗APNG is not GIF
> 
> **Maximum File Size:** 512 kb
> 
> **Dimensions:** 320 x 320 pixels _exactly_
