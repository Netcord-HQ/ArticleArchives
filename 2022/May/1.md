Before getting into the fun process of how to get your server verified, let us first understand what Verified Discord Servers are.

What is a Verified Discord Server?
==================================

According to Discord, Verified Servers are a manifestation that the server is an affiliated community of a brand, business, or a figure of public interest. Think of it as an achievement that you’ve managed to lead a group of people perfectly and expand your network.

How to get your Discord Server Verified — The Correct Way
=========================================================

Discord themselves has written a blog on this topic but I like to add some things to that point. Make sure that you have these things when you apply for verification:

• **Originality** — Your server must be unique and should be able to represent you or your brand. You must be the one in a million people who are thinking as same as you.

• **Getting Recognized** — Discord looks to verify those who are strongly followed and recognized. Be active in Social Media too, they check your presence, your style of interacting with others, etc.

• **Social Media Connection** — Ensure to connect your social media accounts with Discord so that they can view the statistics and check if you are applicable for verifying your Discord Server.

• **Using a Formal Email Address** — Make sure to use a formal email address while applying for Verification. Ex. contact@rastrocreates.com. _(This is a fake email id, I’m in no way affiliated for no response from the above-given address.)_

Verified Servers VS Partnered Servers
=====================================

Verified Servers are online communities run by companies, corporations, and public individuals. You’ll know you’re in the official home for that brand, person, or any other subject matter if you see a Verified badge.

The Discord Partner Program is aimed to recognize and reward quality, active servers by providing them with additional resources to help them invest in their communities. If the server’s name has a Partner badge next to it, you know it’s one of the best out there.

**NOTE**: Your server must follow [**Discord’s ToS**](https://discord.com/terms) and [**Community Guidelines**](https://discord.com/guidelines), if you’ve failed to, your application will be rejected.
