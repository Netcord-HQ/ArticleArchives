Discord partnership is something many people strive for. And for a good reason too.

Becoming a partner gets you some pretty snazzy benefits, such as **free Discord Nitro**, a free partner-exclusive hoodie, profile badge, benefits for your server, and much more!

Becoming a Discord partner is not easy, today I will be explaining a way that you can become one, and I know my stuff, as I myself am a Discord partner!

The first thing you would want to do, is of course have a server.

But not just any server is going to help with becoming a Discord partner, your server needs to be these three things:

1 — An original idea.
---------------------

This is the base of your server, and nobody likes copy cats. Make sure your server is unique and is a topic that people want to be apart of a server for.

2 — Good branding.
------------------

By this I mean having something like your dog as a server about books is not a good idea, you want your server’s branding to look nice. Having a nice logo and banner is great to help your server become a successful community. Keeping the theme of your server is also important, make sure that everything in the server relates and fits the topic.

3 — Having professional staff.
------------------------------

Having professional staff and being professional yourself is a key element for becoming a Discord partner, and building a stable community.

Now once you think your server is good enough to apply for Discord partner, you will have to meet Discord’s set criteria. You must have 500 members in your server, the server must be over 8 weeks old, and must have 2FA enabled for all moderators.

You can find all the them under the Partner Program tab in server settings(must be a community server). Now these are just the bare minimums. And a lot of servers don’t get partnered when they are smaller, although it is very much possible as I myself got partnered around 660 members!

Someone from Discord will join your server.
-------------------------------------------

Make sure to put your best feet forward in this time. Your server should also be a welcoming and kind community. You are most likely not going to get partnered if your server is toxic and non-welcoming. You also want to make sure your server is easy to get around, as the partner scouts like to see servers that are easily understandable!

These are just some tips to getting partnered, and just because you have a server that follows everything, and is a good server does not mean you will get accepted.

Good luck in your journey to becoming a Discord partner!
