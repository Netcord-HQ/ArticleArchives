Over the past few months we have been seeing new Discord features left and right.

Majority of the new features are absolute game changers. We are super excited for features like Forums, Home Page, Modals, and whatnot to come out of the beta phase and available to the public.

Let’s look at a few features Discord could add that would make our lives on Discord much better.

Auto Compress Large Files
=========================

This is already a feature on Discord mobile. It would be really nice for Discord to compress files when we upload them to Discord if the limit doesn’t fit.

> I am NOT talking about files that are uploaded in chats. That would defeat the whole purpose of the Nitro perk that lets you upload larger files in chat.

I am talking about files like profile pics, server icons, server banners, emojis, stickers, role icons, and such.

Every time I make an icon, I end up making it too high quality and have to manually compress it. On top of that, the animated GIF comes out way higher than the limit.

So it would be nice for Discord to compress those files and save us some time and effort.

Built-in Message Translator
===========================

There are so many international Discord users. It would be a great feature for us to translate non-English text directly in Discord.

I know there are probably bots out there that do this. But having it built-in would open new gates to millions of users that have trouble speaking English.

At first I thought maybe it would be quite expensive to implement that. But it’s actually quite cheap. Company wise.

[Google’s Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate/pricing) costs around $20 per million characters. At a scale of Discord, it would fill out very fast. Discord approximately receives a billion text messages every month so I guess it wouldn’t be _that_ expensive.

And of course, there is always the option to make it Nitro only perk.

Let Mods Spoiler Other’s Texts
==============================

There are times when I am moderating, and there is something that isn’t quite rule violation. So little so that it’s not worth deleting the entire content.

And too violating to leave it untouched.

I think it would be a great feature to let moderators spoiler content from some else. I have some loose ends of this on my mind but I’m sure the Discord team would be able to figure something out.

Voice Notes
===========

Voice Notes. That’s it. That’s the point.

We should be able to send voice messages in DMs and Discord server chats.

Also, I would like to mention that we should be able to listen to audio files in Discord mobile without having to download it.

Pinning Friends
===============

We should be able to pin DMs. It will make it so much better for people like us who have multiple DMs everyday.

Built-in Ban Appeal System
==========================

Imagine how efficient it would be to have a built in ban-appeal system built into Discord.

Since banning is a huge factor of moderators and Discord, it would make the most sense to let users get a second chance and appeal their bans that may or may not have been a false ban.
