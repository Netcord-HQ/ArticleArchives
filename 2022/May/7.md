> “One of the reasons we did this was because all the payment processors will no longer support payments coming from Russia. The extra time our customer support would have to spend with Russian users would have been overwhelming.” said a Discord employee.

After the shut down McDonald’s and several other services in the Russian market, it was expected that Discord will also, at one point or another, have to step aside their paid subscription.

What does paused billing look like?

You cannot access the Nitro purchase tab like you would normally.

Unfortunately though, for the users in Russia this blocked page shows up blocking them from purchasing Nitro for the time being. This block also seems to be effecting the purchases of Nitro boosts.

Basically, all in-app purchases of Discord (and several other companies) are blocked in Russia.

Reason for Pausing
==================

We are all aware of the terrible situation of war in the countries of Ukraine and Russia. Many innocent lives have suffered because of what’s been happening.

Reddit user u/TecDeveloper shared an argument that many found interesting. “It is not the peoples fault that they are in war though” he said. To which a Discord’s employee with the name u/Jethro82 said “One of the reasons we did this was because all the payment processors will no longer support payments coming from Russia.”

So Discord didn’t stop the billing, they payment processors bound them to. Jethro82 also said “The extra time our customer support would have to spend with Russian users would have been overwhelming.” which is understandable because I am sure they have better queries to solve other than answering the same question to Russian users. So they paused the billing within the app instead of proceeding to a failed payment to merchant page on their payment processors.

Would VPNs bypass the block?
============================

Kinda but it’s complicated. VPNs won’t do anything on it’s own as long as you’re using a Russian card. You have to have a valid card that wasn’t registered in Russia + a VPN to complete the payment.

You can’t purchase it but sources say you can accept Nitro gifts with a VPN!

This article is not to share opinions on the complicated topic of war and politics. Consider this a simple news article about the recent pause of Nitro billing in Russia!
