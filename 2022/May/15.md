**What is a Discord Badge?**
----------------------------

Badges are small images that display on user profiles and profile popups that distinguish a user as a member of specific groups. Some are easily accessible, while others are exclusive or no longer obtainable. On a profile, badges appear in a hierarchical order, and multiple badges stack.

**Let’s go over each Discord Badge and how to obtain them.**

Following that, we have a rare badge that only a few people possess. This badge is extremely difficult to obtain and requires that you own a server with over 500 members. The partnered server badge indicates that you own a Discord-partnered server.

To be considered, your Discord server must be 8 weeks old, should have 2FA enable and have at least 500 members and at least 50 active members per week. Following completion of these requirements, go to your server settings and select the “Partner Program” tab to apply to become a Discord partner.

**Bug Hunter Badge**
====================

People who can find and report bugs to Discord are given the bug hunter badge. But it’s not as simple as it appears.

Bug hunter badges come in two different colors. You have successfully reported multiple bugs to Discord if you have a green bug hunter badge. A golden bug hunter badge, on the other hand, indicates that you have reported numerous bugs to Discord. Unfortunately, no specific numbers are provided, so you’ll have to wait.

To get started, join the [Discord Testers server](http://discord.gg/discord-testers) and register as a bug hunter. After that, you must follow the instructions and complete a quiz. You’ll be able to get a role and begin bug hunting once you pass the quiz.

**Discord Certified Moderator Badge**
=====================================
