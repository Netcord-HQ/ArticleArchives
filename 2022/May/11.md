Are you confused on which colors to use for your roles? Are they contrasting enough? Do they look good on both dark and light modes?

The answer to all of the questions is Dragory’s role preview tool. Dragory is a well known Discord tools and resources builder.

This tool allows you to visualize how your roles will look on different colors and how it will look on light mode on dark mode. It also gives you a general analysis on how well contrasting the color is. Is it too harsh on the eyes? Too dark to see? It gives you pretty great feedback on the contrast ratio.
