Discord, being the fun-laid back company and platform that it is, is turning 7 Seven years old tomorrow. That is 13th of May. And itâ€™s a Friday ðŸ‘»

What we know from Discord
=========================

Yesterday, Discord published this tweet.

This pretty artwork contains the dates May 13th to 16th. From that we know itâ€™s going to be a 3/4 days event.

Itâ€™s also worth joining the official **Discord Townhall server** early because 4 months ago last year when it was time for the Snowsgiving event, it was the first server to have over 1 MILLION members! It was huge and some unlucky folks couldnâ€™t take part in the server because of how many members there were.

What happened in the past
-------------------------

Discord gave out hundreds of Nitro codes to the community in their twitch and YouTube livestreams. So itâ€™s worth keeping an eye out in their live stream channels to see if they might do it again.

Community Projects & Participation
==================================

------------------------------------------------

A community-ran project that has been a tradition for a couple of years now. Every year, at this week of Discordâ€™s birthday, users around the world change their PFPs and Server Icons to a shade of the blurple color.

The blurple color is Discordâ€™s primary color in itâ€™s palette.

This year in particular, two Discord users came up with the program Thank You Discord. As a way of thanking Discord for being the awesome platform that they are.

The premise of this project was that users all around could send their Discord username in a banner which is delivered to the real Discord Headquarters in California.

Anyone could sign this banner. And a lot of people did. Weâ€™re talking 16,693 to be exact. This is what the final banner looked like.

The banner signing process has closed and you can no longer sign the banner if you hadnâ€™t when it was open.

We canâ€™t wait to see how the event would unfold and how Discord would react to this huge birthday card tomorrow!

Kudos to the team behind both the projects and on behalf of Netcord, I wish all of you best of luck.
