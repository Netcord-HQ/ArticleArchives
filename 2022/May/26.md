**discord.style** is one of the largest community-driven sites to find Discord templates. [The filed report](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/pdf/2022/d2022-1112.pdf) contained that the domain name _discord.style_ was allegedly used as “bad faith”, yet being a completely free tool that generated $0 revenue in the last 2 years of its existence.

The domain was registered at NameCheap by user [@TweetAudun](https://twitter.com/tweetaudun), who is also the owner of the domain [_minecraft.gg_](https://minecraft.gg/)_,_ and [Discord Bot List](https://twitter.com/dlistgg). NameCheap is being forced by Discord to transfer the ownership to Discord, Inc. because of the claim, said Audun.

Why Discord Wants It
====================

The said domain was only seemed to be distributing Discord Templates and it does not justify this claim.

Moving forward, the site formerly available at discord.style has now moved to — [**https://dsc.st/**](https://dsc.st/)

Users have already started speculating what Discord might need that domain for.

Hint of custom themes on the app?
---------------------------------

A highly requested feature by the Discord community is the ability to change or add custom themes on the app. Modifying the client the in any way is against Terms of Service so using BetterDiscord and other client modifications is out of equation.

What makes us think this — is the new Variables that can be seen in the new datamine updates.

According to [**DiscordPreviews.com**](https://discordpreviews.com/custom-themes-might-be-coming)**,**

> added a lot more CSS variables including such as `chat-background` or `modal-background` which seem all too convenient as to not make them changeable by users.

Is this the first?
==================

Certainly not. Discord have taken over multiple domain names from multiple holders as they break Company trademark laws.

This tweet shows how Discord disputed these domains over the years.

1.  **discord-server.com**
2.  **discord-merch.com**
