20 Amazing Event Ideas for your Discord server

Best Discord Event Ideas
========================

Events are a great way to make your server active and engage with your community. It’s always fun to host a new event every once in a while in your server. It doesn’t have to be seasonal you can make them anytime. And with Discord’s new Events channel, it’s easier than ever.

Let’s get started!

1\. Art Competition
===================

You can host an art competition in your server where members submit their art on a given topic. You can make the competition limited to digital drawings, comic doodlings, hand painted, profile picture designing, banner designing, flag designing. The only limit is your imagination!

2\. Kahoot!
===========

[Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/?utm_name=controller_app&utm_source=controller&utm_campaign=controller_app&utm_medium=link) is where you can create quizzes for your members to participate in. It brings great engagement in voice chats when you are playing it. Make it more fun by adding funny questions to your Kahoot.

3\. Gartic Phone
================

[Gartic Phone](https://garticphone.com/) is another really fun online game you can play with your members. It’s an internet game that combines Pictionary with the Telephone game (in which you whisper into the ear of the next person and compare the original sentence to what was spoken). This is the visual counterpart of the game, in which you sketch what you see and then guess what you saw!

4\. Quiz / Hotseat Questioning
==============================

Do it in a stage for maximum fun. Get 1 member from the audience to the stage and quiz them. The audience will listen along for entertainment. Switch up the hotseat with another member after you are done quizzing the first member. Do it a couple of time, it’s so fun.

5\. Talent Show
===============

Members will raise their hands in a stage channel and the host(s) will pick one by one. Members will show their talent for the hosts to judge. The hosts will then rate them, the participant with the highest score or the participant with a perfect score will win.

6\. Inter-server giveaways
==========================

Something special happening? Collaborate with a server similar to your niche and host a inter cross giveaway. Not only this will increase engagement, it will also increase your growth rate by a ton! So it’s definitely worth it to keep a bigger prize.

7\. Skribbl.io
==============

[Skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/) is an online multiplayer drawing game where each player receives a word which they have to draw for everyone else to guess. If he draws it well and others guess it correctly, everyone gets points. If you guess wrong, guess late, or don’t guess at all, you will get lesser points. The one with the highest points wins the game.

You can also add custom words to the mix so it’s a bit more themed and fun to play around for a long time.

8\. Minecraft Event
===================

If you have a Minecraft server for your community discord server, or vice versa, you should host a Minecraft event. An event hosted in your Minecraft server!

9\. Debate Competition
======================

Make groups and debate on the silliest topics depending on your server or event theme. More importantly have fun debating and make sure to respect each other’s opinions.

10\. Internet Scavenger Hunt
============================

These are quite hard to set up initially but are actually really fun. You can make it as small, short, and sweet or as large, engaging as you want. It’s totally up to you.

What happens here is basically you hide clues anywhere in your server, and players will find the clues one by one to find the final hidden message — which, many servers, have made a Nitro gift link.
