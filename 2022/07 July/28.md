Discord bots are powerful tools, but they can also be dangerous. If you're not careful, you could end up with a bot that spamming your server with unwanted messages or even worse, stealing your personal information.

So before you add a bot to your server, take a moment to read this quick guide. We'll go over some of the risks of adding bots and how you can avoid them. By the end, you'll be able to add bots to your Discord server with confidence.

Unsafe Bots
-----------

I'm sure we've all had that moment where we add a new Discord bot and then immediately regret it. You know the one - you wake up the next morning to find that your server has been taken over by a bot that is spamming memes and playing loud music.

Well, I'm here to tell you that you can avoid this fate by being careful with who you authorize to add bots to your server. In this article, I'll share some tips on how to keep your server safe from rogue bots.

If you're not careful, authorizing a Discord bot can be a dangerous proposition. After all, you're giving the bot access to your account, and it could potentially do all sorts of things, including stealing your identity or spamming your friends. So, before you authorize a bot, be sure to do your research and make sure it's a reputable bot.

The Problem
-----------

If you add a bot you find the authorization page where people just add the bots without checking the perms or the authorizations.

This can be dangerous because there might be a permission where it says **Join Server for you**. This allows the bot or the owner to join any server with your account.

These servers may include NSFW servers , fake Nitro drops or anything.

This is a very Dangerous permission to grant.

Also if you click continue check the redirection after adding the bot. It might redirect you to a different website where it might tell you to do a QR code scan.

The redirection after authorization here for example is google.com

How to be safe from such scams?
-------------------------------

If you are adding a bot to you server , always make sure that

*   The Bot is Verified
*   It doesn't have a **Join Servers for you** permission
*   It doesn't redirect you to a shady website

If you have already authorized such Bots then

*   Go to User Settings
*   Click Authorized Apps
*   Select your Bot and Click Deauthorized

What Discord is Doing
---------------------

Discord is currently working on a new tab which will appear on the bot's profile menu which can show the user which data of the server is being accessed by the bot.
