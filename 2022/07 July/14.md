Graphic Design could be one of the most important skills you can learn in 2022. In times like these, you don't need to hire a designer, or look for a freelancer. Design resources (free, paid, and cheap) are served to you on a silver platter.

And we all know the potential of mastering Graphic Designs. Last year, globally, the graphic design industry was worth $45.8 billion. That is why, graphic design is considered one of the best skills to learn to make money.

In this article, today you are going to learn secret tips and tricks for graphic designers to improve design skills. This article features some hidden tricks, used by professionals and beginners.

#1 Add noise to 'fake quality'
------------------------------

This is a hidden trick I learned along the way. If you're like me, you find it very difficult to find good high quality PNGs on Google. Not to mention, actual PNG files and not fake ones with a checkerboard pattern.

Noise is a lifesaver. I personally have opted in the saying "when in doubt, add noise". This type of noise may also be referred to as Grain. It is essential that you only apply it sparingly. Excessive noise is the easiest way you can ruin a perfectly good graphic design.

#2 Keep it in the family
------------------------

It is ideal that you use no more than 3 font families. Using more than 3 types of fonts can be hard to look at. You'll be facing issues with maintaining the hierarchy in your graphic/website.

Try using font families with more font variants. A perfect place to find fonts like these is [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Utilizing font weights is another great tip.

#3 Utilize white-space
----------------------

In Graphic Design, whitespace is the area in between the elements. These areas can contain their own hidden meanings. It can be a very abstract

Your designs does not have to be covered with information/graphics in every inch. Utilize white-space. Scale up the things that are more important. Let your eyes take over. Try to visualize what you'd prefer to see when at your first glance.

#4 Don't fear scale
-------------------

Your important heading, should be loud and clear. If you want the message to go through clear. Scaling  your important elements is the easiest way to grab the viewer's attention.

#5 Designing shouldn't be exhausting
------------------------------------

If you like doing something, a hobby, don't overwork yourself into making it feel like a job.
