What is Discord Admin Community
-------------------------------

Discord Admin Community, or DAC for short, is a space for community owners, admins, and moderators to come together and discuss the subject matter of community management.

[According to Discord themselves](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5309276245271-Discord-Admin-Server-FAQ), “Here you can learn more about features, use best practices, and meet other members who want to improve their communities!”

Here, you will find help regarding anything related to community building and management. That is, server insights, resources, moderation, safety, and even coding & bots.

Join Requirements
=================

Joining the admin community is very simple, in fact, the requirements are pretty simple. Here’s what they are.

*   Have **at least 500 members** in your community
*   Server has to be **at least 3 months old**
*   [**Community feature**](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server) must be enabled
*   Have at least a 40% **monthly member retention** rate

Can only Admins join the community?
-----------------------------------

No. The community is open to anyone who has `MANAGE SERVER` permissions in the server. Given that, the concerned server meets all the requirements.

There, the server will open to the owner, the administrators, the moderators (if they have `MANAGE SERVER` permissions). In essence, anyone with that permission in a qualified server may join the admin community.

How to Join Discord Admin Community
===================================

To join the Admin Community Server:

*   Go to your Server Settings
*   Click on “Overview” In the Community section
*   Click “Join Discord’s Admin Server”

The only way to join Discord’s Admin Server is via desktop, there are no ways to join it through the mobile app — yet.

How to identify the real server
-------------------------------

If you ever come across a server posing to be Discord Admin Community, check for the `VERIFIED` symbol next to the server name. The official community is a verified server with a check mark to help you identify it better.

It is most likely that you will never receive a DM about it, but in case you do, look for the `SYSTEM` tag beside the username. Moreover, here’s an article to help you identify official Discord messages.
