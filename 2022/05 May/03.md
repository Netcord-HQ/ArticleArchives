I want to expose you to something that, “The more engageable bots you have in your server, a gradual increase in the server activity starts to show up.”

The Critical Numbers & The Breakdown
------------------------------------

You want to have at least 4 to 7 bots in your servers. Don’t know why? Let’s break it down.

**Moderation Bots:** The moderation bot you choose has to be one of the most critical decisions you make. You have to have a minimum of 1 . Moderation Bot in your server to moderate and mitigate any critical incidents that might happen to your server. I would like to have 2 bots one for Moderating and one for Logging critical and little things that happen in the server. Ex. [Parallel](https://parallel.wtf) for commands & [Dyno](https://dyno.gg) for Logging.

**Utility Bots:** These are the bots that you can have according to your server’s needs. I would recommend at least 2 to 3 bots. These bots help you build a stronger and healthier community from the start. You can have suggestion systems, ticket systems, and leveling systems. These kinds of bots are going to help your server improve by receiving more feedback. Ex. [Arcane](https://arcane.bot), [Sapphire](https://sapph.xyz), and [Carl Bot](https://carl.gg).

**Miscellaneous Bots:** These bots are called “engageable” bots that increase your server’s activity. It would be awesome if you had a minimum of 2 bots. But these bots can also burden you with spam. So be careful with how you manage these bots. You can add [Dank Memer](https://dankmemer.lol/), [Unbelievaboat](https://unbelievaboat.com/), [TriviaBot](https://lakeys.net/triviabot/) and  
[Countr](https://countr.xyz/)

**Music Bots:** These are a must-have for your servers as members want to relax with some chill and easy-to-use music bots. Make sure that you add a bot that doesn’t ask you to pay for every single command. You can consider adding [Diva](https://dsc.gg/divamusic), [Chip](https://chipbot.gg/home), and [Lofi Radio](https://top.gg/bot/830530156048285716). Note that some bots even have more than 5 versions of their bot, so if you want that feature [Diva](https://dsc.gg/divamusic) and [Chip](https://chipbot.gg/home) bots have that feature.

What about an all in one bot?
-----------------------------

It’s a great choice. There are many multi purposes or all in one bots that do an awesome job. Do keep in mind that if it has an outage, most of your server features will be down.

Final Thoughts
--------------

You should understand that a bot not only makes your server protected but it also takes your server’s feedback and activity. It reduces the burden of always being active in the server and moderating every single thing that’s happening in the server.
