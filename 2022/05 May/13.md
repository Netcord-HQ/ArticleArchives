It feels like around 4 months ago that the news of Discord announcing a rebrand surfaced on Discord. It’s crazy to think that it has officially been 1 year since this happened.

Why did the internet hate the new Discord Rebrand?
--------------------------------------------------

There are multiple reasons as to why a lot of people hated the rebrand like:

> _The new font is “childish” & and the new Blurple color is hard to look at_

A Defense For The Rebrand
=========================

! Take the following with a grain of salt as I share my personal opinions !

As much as I loved the old Discord colors and logo, I am starting not to hate the rebrand. Call it adaption or compromising. Love it or hate it, the new logo was here to stay altogether.

The old logo was not symmetrical!
---------------------------------

Discord said so themselves. The old logo/icon of Discord was hard to notice in small surfaces like that of pins or taskbar icons. Not only that, the curves in the old logo are as inconsistent as they come. Unlike in the new logo where everything is very well symmetrical and consistent.

The muddyness of the old Blurple
--------------------------------

Let’s look at it from a business perspective. They need to attract new visitors at first glance. And bright colors are the way to go in that case. The old color was a great choice but it must’ve been terrible for marketing. It has the gray muddy look to it.

And the other colors to complement the new Blurple are a great addition!

The font
--------

I don’t hate the new font. Or the old font. I don’t like either of the wording. Though I do like the in-app and web fonts used by Discord.

In case you don’t know what they are — Ginto, Whitney, and Helvetica.
