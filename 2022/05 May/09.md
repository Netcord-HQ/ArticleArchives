JUST IN: New “Discord Sex Hack” takes over Discord
==================================================

New “hack” floods Discord as GIFs turn into a weird meme after using the s/e/x command. Here is how it works.

It is not a hack. Here’s what it is.
====================================

*   You send a GIF in any Discord channel
*   Followed by “s/e/x” (without quotes) in the same channel
*   The GIF you sent magically changes to a meme.

Here’s it in action:

Do not waste your time scanning the QR code because it only leads you to the creator’s tweet.

The s/e/x command
=================

The **s/** command is a built-in function integrated within the app. You can replace certain parts of your previously sent

> The actual command is
> 
> s/\[text you want to replace/\[text you want to replace it with\]

This is why **s/e/x** command works only on tenor GIFs.

> When you run the command, the **“e”** in [https://t**e**nor.com/](https://tenor.com/) get’s replaced with **“x”** entirely changing the domain name leading to [https://t**x**nor.com/](https://txnor.com/)

The domain txnor.com is owned by [u/Rebane](https://www.reddit.com/user/rebane2001) and he made it so that the domain leads embeds [this](https://i.redd.it/x22kbf1zydy81.png) image.

Tweet by the creator:

This is (kind of) permanent.
============================

Unless the creator’s ownership of the domain name expires or a bug in the code occurs, this is probably the first “User Generated Discord Easter Egg”. **rebane2001 here has made history.**

Unfortunately, it only works on tenor GIFs so thats a bummer for Giphy and I believe it is limited to Desktop Clients. Sorry mobile users!

Make it more fun:
-----------------

Try out sending **s/e/x** again 😉  
or instead of the first **s/e/x**, try **s/w/ag**
