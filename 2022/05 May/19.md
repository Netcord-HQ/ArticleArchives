Beta users of Android Discord are missing Amoled mode (also known as Ultra dark mode) as per the latest version 128.8 of Beta testers Discord. This isn’t a bug, Discord is actually removing it from the mobile app.

What is Discord Amoled mode?

The 3 Modes of Android Discord

Amoled is (was) an experimental extra dark theme for Discord that is only available for android users. It’s hidden in the normal menu but you can unlock the option to enable amoled mode by clicking on Dark mode 9 times. You will see an option to enable amoled mode.

Wait! I still have amoled mode on my device?
--------------------------------------------

You probably aren’t a Beta tester for Android Discord. Or if you are, you haven’t updated your app to the latest patch of it.

How do I get it back?
=====================

As many users liked this unique theme, a Reddit user by the name of [u/DiamondOreMaster267](https://www.reddit.com/user/DiamondOreMaster267/) found a workaround to it.

**Step 1️⃣: Enable Developers Mode in your settings**

**Step 2️⃣: Find the option “Force Dark mode” and turn it on**

**Step 3️⃣: Disable “sync across clients” in your Discord app  
**This is to prevent your eyes from sudden flash of light in the desktop version because of the next step.

**Step 4️⃣: Enable Light mode in your Discord app  
**Enjoy.

How does it work?
-----------------

It does not force turn on amoled mode. Amoled mode is pure jet black in color in order to “save battery”. This tricky shenanigan only forces Discord’s light mode to turn into a different (still darker) mode with the help of androids built in “Force Dark mode” developer mode feature.

Like the screenshot says, it is indeed broken but does it work? Yes.

Amoled mode on desktop/pc?
--------------------------

There is no amoled mode on desktop and browser clients. Only the mobile app on android does. Sorry iOS users!

Is there an Ultra Light Mode?
-----------------------------

Surprisingly, if you click light mode on your Discord mobile app 5 times, your screen will turn completely blank and white. Discord will also temporarily turn on your flashlight to give you the full “When light mode isn’t enough” experience as Discord says. It goes back to normal light mode after a few seconds.
