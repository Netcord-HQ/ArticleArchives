What is Localized Nitro Pricing?
================================

According to [**Discord’s official article**](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407269525911-Nitro-Localized-Pricing-FAQ) regarding this, they are reducing or adding a discount on Nitro purchases based on the country you are purchasing from.

> Localized pricing is available for **Brazil**, Turkey, Poland, Australia, the Philippines, Peru, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Japan.

Money is a complex matter and to maximize the sales, it’s necessary to evaluate your product price according to the currency of the region.

Right now, it’s only available on a select countries and they said they don’t have plans to add Localized Pricing to any more countries at this time.

**But exactly how cheap are we talking?**
-----------------------------------------

Below is the full chart of all the price differences in all the available countries. Some differences are small, yet they are there. While some other differences are $2-$5! That’s insane!

— General Questions and FAQs
----------------------------

“Can I use a VPN to get lower prices?”
--------------------------------------

No. The localized prices depend on your payment method so you must also have a Japanese credit card to get the price of Japan. For PayPal users, the billing address must be set to a Japanese address.

“Can I get my friend to gift me a lower price Nitro?”
-----------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately not. Any Nitro gifts purchased in any region will have the same regular price as in USD. There goes your exploitation plan.

“I purchased month of Nitro/yearly Nitro before Localized prices were available. Can I get a refund?”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Discord will not refund in that case. Though they are happy to issue a refund with any case that falls in their [**refund policy**](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071). They will try to sugarcoat it but in reality, they will not issue a refund in this case.
