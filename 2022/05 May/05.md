Your staff members are the role models of your community.

They should know exactly what the goals of your server are, how you’d like to present your community/brand as, and what actions should be taken on what violations.

It will be easier for both your upper staff and you, when a new batch of staff members get into your team.

How to write the Perfect Guide Book for your Discord Staff
==========================================================

If it’s your first time writing a guide book it could a little difficult to come up with ideas on how to fill your guide book with. Here are some ideas for your guide book that will make your staff’s experience on your server much easier.

Rules for your Staff
--------------------

Much like a “**Dress Code**” in a real employee handbook or a school code, write about how your team should present themselves (as in here, there accounts) in front of the community. This means no NSFW content anywhere in their public profile and following the general server rules of your server.

In my server I also have a rule for the staff that prevents them from sharing any messages from the private staff only channels.

Punishments for Violations
--------------------------

A list of violations that would get a user warned, a list of violations that would get a user timed out, a list of violations that would get a user banned and so on. Having a well written list of set written rules avoids the inefficient conversation of “hey is this a ban?”.

Clearly mention the punishments and also explain the other automatic systems you might have set up into the server.

Keep room for improvement
-------------------------

As your community grows and develops, expect the guide book to, too.

Mention Appreciation
====================

Let them know that you are grateful for whatever they are doing. Especially because it’s most likely voluntary. Thank them for showing interest in moderating your community.

Also mention what you’d expect from the moderators, how to get around the case workflow, and what qualities you value. So they know how they would ask for a promotion.

Final Words
===========

A Staff Guide book is important. So much so that they need your importance while you write them. No need to hurry yourself into it. Put your thought and effort into the guide and trust me it is going to be worth it. Think of your target audience and balance their needs and wants with those of your staff team and the server’s goals, too.
