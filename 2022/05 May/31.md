The Issue
---------

Twitter videos on Discord does not work properly — the audio quality is terrible, video playback is terrible, video quality is terrible.

Why? Because sharing a generic Twitter video link on Discord, for example:

> https://twitter.com/person/status/1234567890

Sharing this link on Discord, forces Discord to use Twitter’s video embedding system. If you want to watch the Twitter video with a better experience, you need to visit the link and have it open your browser and lead to the site where you can watch the video.

The Fix
-------

Someway somehow, editing the link from “twitter.com” to “**twxtter.com**” makes an entirely different embed that has a much better video player — with great video and audio quality and perfect playback.

Embed with twitter.com

Embed with twxtter.com

**A really fast way to do this** — is by sending the link then on your Discord app typing `s/i/x` which is the substitute command built-in to the Discord client.

But is it really worth the effort? Is it safe?
==============================================

There was another domain that lets you change the way videos are embedded on Discord. It was where you would change `twitter.com` to `vxtwitter.com`.

VxTwitter is basically a fork of another project made by [Robin Universe](http://blog.hirob.in/aboutme/) called FxTwitter which was made with an intend to Fix Twitter. Twitter links just won’t work on Discord back then.

However, FxTwitter had to be eventually shut down because of a lot of reasons that you can read [**_here_**](http://blog.hirob.in/2022-05-16-Goodbye-TwitFix/)!

The main reason was that Robin could see the tweets being shared with his domain. People sharing illegal media with his domain were reported to Twitter authorities.

[It’s worth reading the story from the creator herself if you’re interested.](http://blog.hirob.in/2022-05-16-Goodbye-TwitFix/)

Back to the question, is it safe?

For all we know, `vxtwitter` and `twxtter` are safe to use for general link and video sharing. However, the hardest part would be to make others entrust you with sharing a link like this. It looks like yet another scam link that’s been going around on Discord. In that case, all you need to do is share the person this article!
