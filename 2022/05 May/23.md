We all want to be somewhere we’re comfortable.

Specially online where we are one click away from something that might scar us for the rest of our lives.

What is Discord Server Security?
--------------------------------

A secure Discord server would be one that is safe from all unwanted content. From simple filters like not being able to share NSFW media to more complex setups like anti-raid systems.

Lets go over how you can maximize your server security.

Verification
============

This is the first basic step to server security. When a user joins your server, it is better to have new members pass through a verification process that lets them access the rest of the server.

There are many ways you can go about making this process, there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube with all the different bots that are able to do this. Here’s something worth mentioning though:

> Click-on-✅-reaction-to-verify is **NOT** safe!

Many self bots and raiding tools have this system where they can automatically react to it and verify.

Safer methods would be:
-----------------------

*   Click button to verify
*   Solve Captcha to verify
*   Type `>phrase` to verify

Do keep in mind that this will affect the member retention in your Server Insights. If the verification is too hard to figure out or there’s no provided support on how to verify, the members might get annoyed and leave. This statistic will look bad on your Server Partnership application.

Built-in Automod and Moderation
===============================

Discord’s moderation setting can be a really great way to add reliable security.

A really bad downside to this is that, if you have auto roles set up, Discord will skip Moderation and in addition to that it will also skip Welcome Screen and Membership Screening that you may have set up in your server settings.

However…

This setting takes the cake. I recommend every community server to have this setup to the max.

Additionally, you should also setup 2FA authentication for moderation privileges.

Auto Content Moderation
-----------------------

If you have beta access to this, I think you should opt in for this auto-mod filter over any Discord bot.

We have written an entire article on this feature and its a must read for anyone who’s willing to make their server safer.

Anti Raid Bots
==============

Raids are painful. There are many types of raiding and some may not be entirely inevitable.

Mass Mention Raids
------------------

This is where a user mentions tens of users in a message and spam it in the server. A lot of users get pinged in this and it can hurt your server statistics quite a bit. Many of those that got pinged will leave the server if it continues.

We really cannot “prevent” the pinging because automod bots will not detect a message before it’s even sent. It can only detect it after the deed was done and will take actions from there.

Mass Join Raids
---------------

This is where a raider will join your server with lots of accounts at once and can also spam anything.

If you have a proper verification set up you should be good. There are bots with modules that Auto Ban these accounts that join in a rapid session. Raid-mode is what its called. Bots like [**Wick**](https://wickbot.com/) and [**Altdentifier**](https://altdentifier.com/) have this.

Anti Raid
---------

Using bots you can manage most of the content moderation.

It’s a lot of work to set up complex bots like Wick completely but it’s well worth it. One might also argue that this makes your moderators lazy depending on a bot. While its also worth mentioning that giving unnecessary dangerous perms to bots and mods may be fatal.

It may also be worth setting up a join gate where where accounts under a certain time old are automatically kicked. This is a highly useful and enforced rule in my server. I set my threshold to 24 hours. Accounts that were made in the past 24 hours are not allowed to join the server.

Stay Safe & Sound!
