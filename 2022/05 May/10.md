If you’ve tried to print colored text in your terminal or console with Python or other languages then it will be easy for you.

So, Discord recently released the ability for us to send messages with colorful texts (with background colors!) in codeblocks within Discord. If that doesn’t sound interesting, I don’t know what will.

Here’s me trying to create the Netcord logo with the new ANSI formatting.

What is code block formatting
=============================

When using code blocks, you must have tried putting “cs” “cpp” “js” etc in the first line to format the text inside as the coding language intends to.

ANSI Formatting
===============

In the same way, you can use **_ansi_** in the first line and you can use **any text with any color and even with any background color** with this special code format.

> `\u001b[{format};{color}m`

I know this looks complicated. And truth be told, it is quite complicated. But [here’s a guide](https://gist.github.com/kkrypt0nn/a02506f3712ff2d1c8ca7c9e0aed7c06) on how the formatting works and you can _write_ the colors.

This website let’s you make any ansi code block formatting with ease.

*   Just type your text
*   Select the part of your text you want to color
*   Then click on any of the given colors
*   When you’re done, click the copy button and paste it to any Discord channel!

Unfortunately you are limited to using the given colors because those are all colors ANSI allows on Discord.

For pixel art you would use symbols like “▇” for the given foreground colors, and spaces “ ” for the background colors.

Cool trick: Trim your code block
================================

If you don’t want your pixel art to extend all the way.

Put “> ” after every line.
