If you’re a beginner in Discord, you’ll have some great knowledge on how the “Premium” version of Discord works i.e., Discord Nitro.

What is Discord Nitro?
----------------------

Discord nitro is a subscription which enhances your experience for one low monthly cost. It gives some special and cool perks that non-nitro users don’t deserve to have. Some of the perks are as follows:

*   **Type up to 4000 characters** — Although normal users can have 2000 characters, if you are going to type an essay, Discord Nitro will enhance by allowing you to type till 4000 characters.
*   **Animated Profiles** — Whether it be a banner or a profile picture, Discord allows you to animate and use it to flex on your friends.

If you want to view all the perks available for Discord Nitro, you can view it if you want [here](https://dis.gd/nitro). It also unlocks the full potential of Discord in the platform that you are using in.

Is it worth the money?
----------------------

I could say that if you are really into Discord’s stuff like Server Development, Bot Development or Community Development etc. you need it but if you are just going to use it for chatting with random people and gathering friends online, you might not find it that much useful as you’ll not be using 95% of the perks that they give you.

I personally think that it’s worth the money as it’s giving us some amazing and useful perks to grow a community or even learn something new from scratch.

You can even giveaway nitro for your community as some of them might not have to opportunity to buy one consistently.

Conclusion
----------

At the end of the day, it’s your money and your way of thinking.

If you really think that you’ll be more productive, useful and creative with Nitro, then go ahead buy it or try finding some giveaway servers which giveaway Discord Nitro-s.

Don’t worry after taking the decision, instead build something useful for you and everyone else with the things that you have.
