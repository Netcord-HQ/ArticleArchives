What is a “Home” channel?
-------------------------

A “Home” channel is the home of you server. The main page and the first thing a member will see when joining a server.

What it contains:
-----------------

It is a segmented grid of important activities happening in the server. Let’s go over the segments one by one.

I will be using Displace Discord server to demonstrate the feature, keep reading for more communities known to have this feature.

How do I add it to my server?
=============================

Short answer will be that **you cannot**. This is currently a beta feature which only a very few communities got access to. It will be undergoing massive changes so it’s best to not share our opinion on this just yet.

Segments — Explained
====================

Highlights segment
------------------

It is where the important messages like announcements are shown. For now, it seems to ranking by time and the amount of reactions on given message.

Messages with interactions or reactions from a lot of users in the **last 2 weeks** will be taken from the channel and posted on the top of this Home page.

Upon clicking on the message, it opens the channel the message was posted in on the sidebar as normally a Thread would. Jumping straight to the exact message. You can react to it right from the Home page.

Once you’re caught up with all of the top messages from last 2 weeks, you’ll be greeted with this message.

I feel like “Highlights” part will be a lot more useful if we use it with Forum channels. The server I am demonstrating this in has not yet unlocked forums feature so it’s yet to see how top messages work with highlights.

Now if you don’t know what forum channels are, when they are coming to Discord, check out this article written by us at Netcord.

Left Sidebar
============

Server Information
------------------

The sidebar will have the server icon, the server description, online and total member count.

Believe it or not, this is probably the first built-in public vanilla-Discord server member counter on the desktop client.

To think, there hasn’t been any built-in member counter on a Discord server is astonishing. It only exists on invite links. Also a small rumor says there will be a built in member counter beside the “Public” tag in servers that have discovery enabled.

Active Now
----------

This is where active chats and VCs of the server will be shown. This isn’t overall activeness, channels with the most activity right this moment is shown here.

It also shows your unread/recent messages and the profile pictures of the people talking within the channel.

Upcoming
--------

(“Events” when expanding in scale) This is where you’ll see upcoming Server events.

Not much special about it but it’s nice to see the most important information shown without having to open to event as a whole. At just a glance, I can know when and where the event will happen.

That’s Home channel for you!
