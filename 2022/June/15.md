If Discord Adds Message “Read” Receipts…
========================================

Today Discord jokingly tweeted “what if we had read receipts”, followers are not happy. But really though, what if Discord really had that. Well at first thought, we would consider it a nightmare.

That tweet. That damn tweet.
----------------------------

This morning started out pleasant. Until I opened Twitter. I saw that Discord had tweeted this at 1:45 AM for me.

This is the tweet that started the idea of Discord having read receipts. It’s safe to say that the community wasn’t ready for this. If this is a sneaky little announcement of a feature, I am pretty there will be riots in the streets.

But what exactly are “_read receipts”?_
=======================================

When you’re messaging someone using Whatsapp, Instagram, or Twitter you may or may not have seen the little “seen” tag in the bottom of your reply that lets you know when the other person have seen it.

All these years, Discord had been one of the very few platforms where they don’t have this “feature”. Actually, I wouldn’t call it a feature at all. I like the way how we don’t have read receipts on Discord. And it should stay that way.

And its not just a personal opinion.

The “joke” tweet & the “joke” replies
-------------------------------------

The argument
============

I think I speak for everyone when I say that sometimes we see your message, we don’t want you to know that we’ve seen it, we just don’t have the energy to reply, yet.

And anyone else that begs to differ is probably lying. So no, I do not think Discord should be adding this. And I hope this “joke tweet” is all that it is — a joke.

If however, Discord proceeds in the opposite direction and adds it anyway, the least they can do to prevent riots is add an option to disable this. Of course, disabling it should also mean that you don’t get to see when others have seen your messages. Like Whatsapp. Let me know you’re thoughts.

That’s all!
