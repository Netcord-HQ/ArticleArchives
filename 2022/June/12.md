A “Message Requests” tab is coming to Discord
=============================================

This may be the end to spam bots and welcome DMs. With this latest upcoming addition to communication on Discord, users will finally be able to send message requests.

Like Instagram and Twitter, Discord lacked this feature of “Message Requests” for a long time.

Anyone could DM anyone anything if they shared a mutual server or were friended.

This eventually gave birth to many spam & scam methods.

Meet: Message Requests — Home Tab
=================================

A designated home for first time DM-ers and those that you share mutual servers with.

When someone DMs you, you will not see it right away. It will be securely placed in this sweet drawer of message requests that you can either “accept” or “deny” using the given functions. We will assume that this will only applies to users that are not on your friend-list and that you have mutual server(s) with them.

This is in a super early stage of development and there is no official news or support article for it yet. However, the screenshots are not forged. This has been in development for quite some time now. Here’s another screenshot from a Reddit user.

This opens the possibilities of many things. There are some merits of this feature becoming official and some demerits as well.

This solves DM scams & DM ads
=============================

For the past few months and the last year, scams on Discord have transcended and took a new turn. It seems to be targeting users mostly through DMs. Unsolicited DMs by hacked accounts or bots that send you fake promotions and links to phishing sites.

On the other hand, there’s the never ending amount of solicited DMs from random strangers advertising their server or bot.

Truly, this update would solve the issue of unsolicited DMs as a whole. As we’d never have to see a DM we don’t want to see. This also means no welcome DMs. If you have a bot set up to DM new members as soon as they join, it will probably not be seen at all because it picks up DMs from bots too.

Again,
======

Again, this is nowhere near finished. Let’s not make any more assumptions about this infant feature. The final update to it might be completely different from this so its just a matter of waiting now. We are excited what the talented devs at Discord will have for us next.

That’s all!
