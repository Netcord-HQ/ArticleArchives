The original tweet by Post was replied to, by Discord itself saying:

The server seemed to have existed since June 1st, while announced on 28th. The first message from a human user in the server is by `JLawMcGraw` who does not seem to be a mod or an admin. They also boosted the server 19 times — two of which, were done before Post himself.
