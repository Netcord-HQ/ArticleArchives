Bored Ape Yacht Club — Or BAYC/Bored Ape — for short, is the biggest NFT brand in the world of crypto. Bored Ape NFT is under the project YugaLab which is the parent to many other crypto projects.

Here’s what exactly happened and how BAYC faced a loss of $360K in the matter of minutes.

Boris’ Account Compromised
--------------------------

Boris Vagner, community manager of the project, had their account compromised a few hours before the phishing link announcement.

Getting access to the compromised account was like hitting jackpot for the hacker. The compromised account then proceeded to post a fishy announcement about “an exclusive giveaway” with a link to a fishy website.

> “Hey @everyone we were hacked an hour ago hopefully no one clicked any links, we’ve got back control of the discord and Boris’s account thank god he didn’t delete the whole server.” said Richard Vagner.

NFT scams all around on Discord
===============================

Obviously this isn’t the first NFT scam on Discord. Probably one of the more damaging ones but certainly not the first. Infact, YugaLabs’ Bored Apes have had their officials’ accounts compromised before.

Let this be a wake-up call
==========================

*   Never click on any links that you don’t know where it leads. You may have your accounts compromised without even realizing.
*   If you are in the NFT market-space, it is suggested to have your DMs closed on every NFT server. Phishers will try to DM you fake links that could be harmful to your account. The project will never DM you for any case.

Discord is not made for web3. You have to work around the limitations for now. We all know what happened when Discord _tried_ to implement web3 integrations into the client.

Till then — stay safe, stay happy. And I will see you tomorrow with another burning article.
