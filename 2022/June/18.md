ðŸ”² Leave without notifying other members
========================================

[Ian Mitchell](https://ianmitchell.dev/) made all our Saturdays so much better with this small addition of a feature. For those that are unaware, Ian is a a Senior Software Engineer on the Bots and API team at Discord.

Leaving group chats does not have to be announced to everyone else in the group. Thatâ€™s why, with the latest update on Discord [Canary](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035675191-Discord-Testing-Clients), its now an option to leave without notifying other members.

[From Ianâ€™s Tweet](https://twitter.com/IanMitchel1/status/1537840786447798273/photo/1)

You are now given the option to click on this check-mark as you leave to not annoy the hell out of other members. This reportedly works only on the Canary client of Discord at the moment of writing. However, it shouldnâ€™t take long to make its way in the stable clients very soon.

Do keep in mind that kicking someone off a group chat will still announce it to everyone. They added silent leave but they have not added silent kick just yet.

Why is silent leaving so important?
===================================

There have been many requests to this feature way before [@RivingtonThe3rd](https://twitter.com/RivingtonThe3rd), in fact, many of the requests have been on Reddit with people sharing links and images. Images of someoneâ€™s friend leaving their mutual groups which is now making all of the groups be brought up again on the personâ€™s DM list.

Here are a few examples.
