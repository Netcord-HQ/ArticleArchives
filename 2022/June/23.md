This One Simple Trick Saved Me 500+ Hours (the ‘no hello’ trick)
================================================================

The trick is following ‘no hello’ while communicating. Here’s everything you need to know about [nohello.com](http://nohello.com) and how you can use it to save time.

Do you hate being left on read? Do you hate waiting for texts?

The trick is simple. Embrace **no hello**.

Okay, let’s make sure we are on the same page first. When you’re talking to your colleagues or co-workers, you aren’t genuinely asking how they are. Or even if you are _saying_ it, you aren’t _meaning_ it.

You want an answer or a favor, so just say it. And similarly, pretty sure the other person is busy enough with other works so they would not mind at all. At least I wouldn’t mind at all. They’d most likely love to help you with your issue but probably not up for a small talk while they’re working.

Here’s the entirety of it explained in 2 images.

The images are from [nohello.net](http://nohello.net) — yes someone made a website of it. It’s based on the old popular [nohello.com](https://www.nohello.com/) but that isn’t the point. The point is:

Does that not sound efficient? Not only are you saving your own precious time, you are saving your friend/co-worker/colleague/ or basically anyone’s time.

Instead of saying:
------------------

*   “Hello, are you around?”
*   “hi sophie — quick question.”
*   “You got a sec?”
*   “yt?”
*   “ping”
*   etc.

Say:
----

*   “hey man, what’s up? also, any idea when that thing’s due?”
*   “Hi there! Hope you’re well. I’m after the latest deck, when you get a sec :)”
*   “hey, if you’re not busy, could you update those NFRs?”
*   etc.

Online or offline, I practice no hello. And I recommend you do too. “Imagine calling someone on the phone, going hello! then putting them on hold…”

> This is how I saved hundreds of hours. Without having to wait for additional replies.

The link is pretty popular on [Discord](http://discord.com). It’s thrown around chat-to-chat, dm-to-dm. Even pinned in some channels of servers I am in.

And I hate that I have to mention this: **It does not apply for everyone!** I can imagine someone’s friend dming them “hey man hows its been!” and the person would go “https://nohello.net” and then there’s the awkwardness.

The website is made for co-workers communicating in a work-environment or while speaking to authorities or someone you don’t know personally but wanted to ask a question. Do not let this rule apply to your close friends, they genuinely care about you. Probably.

This is a similar website focused on messages like:

*   Can I ask you a question?
*   Hey you around?
*   Can someone help me?

To get faster and efficient answers, try asking more detailed questions.

Many people love the concept of no hello, and the websites alike. Hence these exist. And it should be entirely your decision if you want to follow them. Just know that the benefit is not only yours but those you contact. As someone who gets lots of messages everyday: **no, it’s not rude at all :)**

But of course, I cannot speak for everyone. Let me know your thoughts on this by [**joining our Discord server**](https://discord.gg/F7v3XCwssK) where we talk about things like these everyday.

That’s all!
