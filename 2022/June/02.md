A new Discord feature just dropped and it’s small but quite helpful.

If you’ve used Discord even for a day, you know how Voice channels work. Of course, you communicate on voice but it can get quite messy to communicate with users who are either having trouble with their mics or don’t have mics at all but want to participate and stay in the loop.

Now what we’ve been doing all this time was having a text channel right above the voice channel for that case. Or simply using `#general` which caused another issue to confuse the non-participants of the voice conversation.

Built-in Text Channel inside Voice
==================================

All non-community servers’ voice channels now come in with a built-in popup text channel that you can use like any normal day. As if it were a text channel except it would be on the sidebar in the voice menu so you don’t have to switch channels.

There’s a lot of misunderstanding with how the text channel actually works — where it gets its permission settings from, does `@everyone` work there?

Keep reading and we’ll make sure you know everything there is to know.

Discord Rickrolled Us Again
===========================

In their latest promotional video, which you can watch right here, there is a short story about 3 anthropomorphic beings having trouble to share a link on voice.

This link they shared, used to lead to an error 404 page but now, after 2–3 hours of the video going public, they changed it.

This link “[**_https://discord.com/vanityurl/dotcom/steakpants/flour/flower/index11.html_**](https://discord.com/vanityurl/dotcom/steakpants/flour/flower/index11.html)**_”_** now leads to the infamous music video of Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley. Why, Discord?

You Should Know
===============

*   `@everyone` and `@here` **do** work like normal so do not go around pinging it because you might upset a lot of people.
*   Community enabled servers have an option to enable or disable this feature.

*   Because of this, voice channels will now also have permissions regarding text channels. So don’t get scared to see “Send Message” permissions config in voice channel settings. This also means permission syncing/inherit with category will work like normal.
