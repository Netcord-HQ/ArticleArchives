Celebrating Pride On Your Discord Community
===========================================

Today, servers all around have been changing their icons and banners to contribute to Pride essence in the month of June.

Today marks the first day of June and end of May.

What’s special about June is that we celebrate Pride month throughout. Communities and companies on social media contribute to the cause by changing their profile pictures and adding rainbows — then taking them off right the second Pride Month ends.

How are Discordians celebrating Pride?

How to contribute
=================

Share the words of love-is-love to your community however you want. Whether it be a simple announcement or going about changing the server icon and banner to a more Pride themed.

There are some servers I know that have had a Pride icon and banner since June of last year. Talk about support. Speaking of support, the server I mentioned is also the support server for Discohook.

Even if its just for 1 day or for the entire month. We should keep in mind that **Pride does not end in June.** In fact, its not ending anytime. We fully support the LGBTQIA+ community to the fullest and being inclusive of our community no matter their identity is what we strive.

How Discord is Contributing
===========================

This article is scheduled to publish in an odd time. There has been no announcements of Pride contributions but I am pretty sure Discord will announce something sometime today or within this week.

Last year, Discord released their own bot, [**Pronoun Picker Bot**](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500012528941), as a way to let other express their personality. The bot works in any server, can be invited to any server and it’s really easy to set up.

It creates pronoun roles in your server and lets your members click a button to choose from the available pronouns. Read the entire FAQ of the bot [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500019844601/buttons.png).

You can add the bot from [**_this_**](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=832258414603534380&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands) link.

That’s all for today — Enjoy your Pride Month!
