I am a self taught graphic designer so the terms I mention are not going to be exactly the same as a professional design and art institute.

The Ground Rules
================

Designing a Logo or a Banner is up to your personal creativity but there are some basic rules that you must follow. I mean not really, but it’s going to make it easier for you and appealing for your community.

Learn Color Theory
------------------

Ever wondered how that one particular artwork looks so better than the one you spent your entire weekend in? Take a look at the colors they’re using. **The science behind colors that look well together is called Color Theory.** And learning it is so much worth it. It can make your 2 minute work into a masterpiece.

Discord Server Banner Tips
==========================

*   Server banners are generally 1920x1080 pixels in resolution

Follow the guide!
-----------------

The entire server banner isn’t visible at all times. **28% of your banner is covered by the name.** Then another part below it is covered by the new and annoying “Public” indicator. It’s always good to align your objects in your banner to the mid right side.

Embed/Channel Header Tips
=========================

*   A good dimension is 1920x720 but you can vertically crop out to your preference

1\. Lightmode users exists
--------------------------

If your background is transparent and your text is plain white or anything super light because it contrasts well for the default Discord chat background color, do not forget about the light mode users. Surprisingly a lot of users use light mode and you should think about their experience on your server as well.

A safer option to the problem above,
------------------------------------

is to just add a background. Your text will show up just right in both modes!

2\. Make it w i d e
-------------------

No, normal 16:9 video format isn’t a good option for this. You should opt in for a way wider image so, horizontally, the title shows up big.

Discord Server Icon Tips
========================

*   Keep it high quality, 1080x1080 is a great resolution

**1\. Do not have the entire server name in your icon!**
--------------------------------------------------------

Your server icon is going to be relatively small, try not to make your users squint for them to be able to view your logo.

It’s a good choice to go with a custom symbol or icon. And in some cases it’s okay to have the name in the icon. If it’s short, catchy, and your entire server identity depends on the “wording” go for it.

But definitely do not throw in the tagline.

2\. Less is more! Simplify it
-----------------------------

Too much detail in your Logo can look horrendous. Keep it simple and make sure it stands out.

3\. Don’t add a full width circle in your icon
----------------------------------------------

If you’ve ever hovered over a Discord server icon, you may have noticed that it turns from a Circle to a Rectangle with large rounded corners.

Do not put entirely different details in the newly revealed areas. Because it can look quite annoying. Refer to images to see what I mean.
