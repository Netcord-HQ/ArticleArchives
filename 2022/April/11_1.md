With millions of users using Discord on a daily basis, there will be a lot unpleasant and toxic users looking to harass others. If you come across users like these and want to report their offensive comments or behavior — here’s how to do so.

Check if their message or action violates Discord’s Guidelines
==============================================================

You should only report someone if their message is in violation of **Discord’s community guidelines**. On Discord, the following activities and messages are not tolerated:

*   Harassment
*   Spam messages
*   Promoting & glorifying suicide
*   Sharing child pornography
*   Cheats, hacks & malware
*   Blackmail & threats
*   Sharing images of gore & animal cruelty

These are quite broad categories, and anything that may be judged to fit under one of them is **potentially in violation** of Discord’s rules. To view the whole list and explanation of **Discord guidelines**, [_click here_](https://discord.com/guidelines)_._

**Filling the Report**
======================

You’ll need to fill out a **report form** if you wish to report a user directly to Discord. This is a **web-based form** in which you must fill out all of the required information as well as provide proof against the user. Follow these steps.

**1:** Go to [**Discord Help Centre**](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us) and then to [**Submit a request**](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)**.**
