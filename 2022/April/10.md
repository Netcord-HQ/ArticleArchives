Do you own a discord server? Well, if you do, then I’m pretty sure that you might wondered at least once about how to keep your discord server active.

Basically, to keep your server active, you just have to keep your server members engaged. Here’s a few tricks from me to you guys to do the magic!

**1\. Owner engagement**
========================

The first basic requirement is that, the owner must be active for at least some time. _“Why”?_

You may think, well, the reason is because, **you own the server**. Duh! Not only does it make you the cool server owner that cares about their server, but also engages your server members to talk in it.

Let’s say your server has around 200 members (typically servers with less than 500 members would averagely gets less messages due to less members), if you want it to be active, just get the members to talk with you, start a conversation, I bet they’ll recognize you as that one cool owner who chats with their server members once when your server **blows** up ;)

2\. **Events**
==============

The second best way is to host cool events.

I’ve tried it out several times and it works, trust me. But the main point is that, you got to host an event which has all the eyes.

Yes, it must be something iconic, and should have all the attention. And give some gifts back to your members who participate in the events, say nitro or custom roles, etc.

3\. Eat, sleep, chit chat about a topic, repeat!
================================================

This is some funny idea that I just thought about while writing this article, haha! Okay so here’s how it goes :-

First things first, if your server has a chat revive role, then ping it, and then talk about some **hot topic** that is on **trend** at present, let’s say, about a sport, or some new movie that has just been released, and maybe if you are good enough in handling stuff, create a quiz of it! Yep, it would come out handy. Try it once!

4\. Just go with the theme
==========================

Something what we all do but actually don’t think about is that, we do stuff that are entirely **against** your server’s theme! Ironic, isn’t it?

What I’m trying to say is, go with the server theme. Let’s say, if your server theme is about games, then stick with it, DO NOT go totally opposite to your theme which would confuse your server members.

But if you think that your server’s theme isn’t something that you don’t like anymore, then feel free to change it, but hey hey! Before doing so, make sure you inform it to your members! They all came there because of you and it’s your responsibility!

5\. Staffs, unite!
==================

Well, this one’s simple. Are you some college student who couldn’t get much time to use discord and manage your server with all these above mentioned tips that could entirely boost up your server which would end up well, well then, the good news is, you have the magical wizards to save your day!

Yes, I’m talking about your staffs. First of all, make sure that your staffs could manage your server while you’re gone, request them to engage members with all the tricks above (optional) or do something on their own which would keep your chat active!

Bonus tips!
===========

1.  If your server’s active and your members like it, then you’ll automatically get members!
2.  If the topics that go around your server is interesting like heck, then don’t worry, you don’t have to worry about your chat being dead.
3.  If you’re some rich dude or could afford stuff to giveaway, then don’t host them very very frequently, then some members would take it for granted. Take a break, and then proceed with what you do.

Anyways, that’s all for this article! Thank you so much for reading upto the end! Signing off, ViBeZ :).
