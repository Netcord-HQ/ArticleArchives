Discord is a platform with over 300 million users all around the world. Discord is an instant messaging application where users communicate with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media, and files.

Therefore, to make sure these “chats” are correctly moderated, moderators or staff members play a crucial part in ensuring user safety.

Moderators keep trolls and rule-breaking members out of the community.  
These people are what keep you from having a negative time chatting on Discord.

Now you know what staff members do, let us jump right in on how to become a better Staff Member yourself.

**1\. Asking for Help**

Moderation can be hard at times, especially when you are new to the topic.

No matter what industry you are working in you will always have flaws within your skillset. Therefore, its okay to ask other staff members for help or advice while moderating discord.

When I first started out in moderation, in many scenarios I would not know what action to take. After asking some of my colleagues for advice and what they had to say about the topic, I could understand the appropriate punishment.

Everyone has weaknesses and we all will not be perfect at everything; therefore, it is fine to ask for help.

**2\. Leading by Example**

Having a special role color and name does not differentiate you from server rules and community guidelines.

Moderators are seen as role models for the server and most members will look up to members of the moderation team. Rather then using your power to intimidate members or bypass certain rules, use your role to empower users to follow the rules and do what is right.

Members are constantly watching your every move and are likely to copy messages/images that you post. Therefore, you should once again be a good role model for members and enlighten them on how to act and behave correctly.

**3.** **Engaging with Staff**
==============================

As the name of the role says, you are part of a _staff_ **team.**

When dealing with large moderation issues, your number one priority should be communicating with your fellow staff members.

The reason Discord Servers hire multiple moderators to join 1 team is to make sure things are done smoothly and efficiently. Letting fellow moderators give opinions on certain issues can largely take lots of stress off your shoulders.

If you are ever in a situation where other moderators part of your team are not being respectful in working in a team, I highly suggest you report that behavior to higher management staff.
