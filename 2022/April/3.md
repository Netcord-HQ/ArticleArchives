“But how can I earn money from a communication platform that’s free to use?” I hear you. If you have a fairly large community server on Discord you can actually put it to a better use — like generating passive income!

Tiers, Patreon, Donation for Perks
==================================

If you have a significantly large community, people already appreciate what you are doing, and some will be glad to financially assist you. Allow these appreciative individuals of the community to give back by taking donations.

It is simple to accept donations just add a link to a PayPal account or set up a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) page for the server. If you are setting up a Patreon, make sure to give them some cool perks to make it worth it for them becoming a patron.

_However_ if you lock most basic features behind a pay wall, it will hurt your community massively. Make sure the perks are either cosmetic upgrades and/or extra features.

Keep in mind that the perks should be something exclusive and original to your server to keep the users hooked.

Selling Advertisements
======================

If your server is on the large side, a lot of people will be interested in buying adverts from you. They will be interested to pay you in order for them to advertised in your server.

A lot of servers (and not just advertising servers, community servers too!) depend on advertisements to fund their personal giveaways, premium and custom bots, advertisements, and even to pay their moderators.

It’s always a good decision to re-invest in your community! :)
