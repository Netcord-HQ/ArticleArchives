> NOTE: This is currently part of a closed experiment! Only a select group of communities are participating with this feature.

Discord communities can now finally monetize their Discord servers with the help of this new feature, namely **Premium Membership**. This is going to allow Discord users, for the first time ever, to make money officially affiliated with Discord.

How does Premium Membership work?
---------------------------------

A Premium Membership in a server allows users to pay monthly for a subscription to exclusive perks and benefits within that server. If you buy a premium membership for a server, you will receive all the perks set by the server owner in tiers.

Who makes money from it?
------------------------

Server owners. This is like built-in Patreon. **This is not Server Boosting with extra steps** because the revenue generated from it will be split between the server owner and Discord.

Right now, sources say, **it’s 90% to the owner, 10% cut for Discord.** Don’t let this be a turn off because platforms like YouTube and Twitch take their cut around 50% so it’s a blessing at most.

Free Trial Feature
==================

Server owners will be able to set a custom “trial” period for tiers. This is going to be a great way to make people buy your premium membership.
