===========================================

This new Discord scam can steal your information when you click on this image? Is this real? Short answer is no, but it’s complicated.

Today started as normal but as I was checking my pings, I noticed a lot servers were warning _@everyone_ about this new “scam” that’d been going around.

Of course I couldn’t just take someone’s word for it. I had to do some research of my own.

The “Scam” goes like this:
--------------------------

You get an unsolicited DM from a stranger. They send and image that doesn’t seem to be loading. They ask a question referring to the forever loading image. So you click on it and they apparently get all your information.

Obviously there’s a lot of things wrong with the description I just gave. And it might not be exactly the same as the description you read somewhere because there’s lots of versions of this Discord scam going on.

Getting hacked by “clicking” on an image is not possible.
=========================================================

Simply clicking on the image in a message to expand it, is completely harmless.

**The trouble begins when you click “open original” to open the image on your browser.**

If the image sent is embedded by a link, the link will show up above the image boundaries and below the persons username. And will take you to the link only if you choose “open in browser”. **Discord will also warn you whether you really want to go to _thisphisingsite.gethacked in your browser_**_._

So either the revolving image, is photoshopped to remove the embedding link, or fake altogether. Making links embed an image when

If clicking on “open original” is supposed to hack you,
-------------------------------------------------------

it must take you to a fake Discord login page. Ultimately, it was you that wrote down the information to your account.

One can send you media in two ways:
===================================

By either directly uploading it to your DMs
-------------------------------------------

Their file will be sent to Discord’s databases from where they’ll send you a compressed version over to you.

By embedding a link
-------------------

Their file is not on the Discord database but rather out on any server on the internet. They will send you direct link to the media and Discord will embed it.

You may have noticed that Discord GIFs are basically links. But tenor and giphy are trusted GIF sources so Discord hides their links from showing up in the message.

If you, however, send a link to a YouTube video, it will show you loads of details regarding that video. Even that it comes form YouTube. And yet, Discord still shows the video link. It doesn’t hide it.

If it’s possible to hack someone from sending an image, why don’t they send it in a server and hack thousands at once? Why DM it?

Keep yourself safe
==================

Never click on links or fill out information without double checking the domain name.
