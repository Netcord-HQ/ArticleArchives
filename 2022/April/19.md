**\- Add unique features**
==========================

If you want your bot to be used you have to add features that are not commonly seen on discord bots or are often hidden behind paywalls.

Understand the “competition” in the market. There are thousands of large public bots with probably features more high quality than yours. What makes yours unique? Supply and demand will take you places. While in this, you have to create both, a demand for your-amazing-bot-idea and keep them hooked that your bot is the best one in that category.

\- Word of mouth
================

This is also a very effective idea. Before expecting it to blow up, talk to your friends about the bot. Have them use it on their servers. Eventually, they will tell their friends about it and then they will tell their friends and so on.

Here, you are making it sure the idea of your bot spreads, but it only does in a controlled manner and between mutuals. Because of the way Discord works and how many users are on this platform, if you get active growing communities to use your bot, your bot will grow in no time.

\- Self Promotion
=================

A majority of “famous” discord server probably has a self promotion channel. Use them regularly (while still following Discord’s and the server’s ToS of course!).

**Make a twitter account for your server.** Interact with other Discord bots on twitter! Get your name out there.

**\- Use Bot listing**
======================

There are bunch of bot list sites such as

*   [top.gg](https://top.gg/)
*   [discordbotlist.com](https://discordbotlist.com/)
*   [discords.com](https://discords.com/bots/)
*   [bot.gg](https://bot.gg/)

You basically submit a form with info about your bot and after some time your bot gets tested by a staff member and either gets accepted or sadly declined. This lets your bot be passively advertised and discovered on the internet without having to do anything regularly.

Moving Forward
==============

Once your bot grows, you may want to get a Support team set up on your support server and work on its further development. Maybe create a website for it. The possibilities are endless.

The journey of a bot developer is amazing. It is fun to create a product multiple users enjoy. Remember to take breaks as needed and do not be ashamed to ask for help.
