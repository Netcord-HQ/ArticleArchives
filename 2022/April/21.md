What are Discord Account Tokens?
--------------------------------

A Discord Account token is unique series of numbers and letters that’s created when you first logged in to your discord account.

A discord token can change when resetting your password. This is essentially your authorization code and it’s passed from the client to the server to verify that you are the account holder.

This is also the reason why you can change basically any aspect of your account (Email, password, profile picture, username, connections) and Discord will still remember it’s you.

What are Discord Bot Tokens?
----------------------------

Discord bot tokens are like a normal token but a person can hack your bot with it. They are generated when you create a bot and it’s necessary to put it in the code of the bot for it to work.

This can also be regenerated with the click of a button on the Discord Developer Portal. If an outsider gets hold of your Bot token, the person can log into your bot just like an account using a bot client and do a-n-y-t-h-i-n-g in the server its in. This is especially dangerous when you have dangerous perms given to the bot on your server.

Why are Discord Tokens valuable?
================================

They are valuable because if someone has your discord token, they can log in to your account with a script and impersonate you.

Say you have nitro and a payment method. Somebody got your **account** token, they can buy nitro and access nitro on your account. The good thing is they can’t change anything except servers, avatars, about me, and status. If you have 2FA, they can’t mess around/delete your server.

The hacker can also get your account terminated and do stuff that’s against Discord ToS. If you are an admin in a big server, like I said in Discord Bot Tokens, they can invite a bot to nuke the server and get everything ruined.

How to keep Account Token safe
------------------------------

Earlier potential hackers asked Discord users to paste a “string of code” to the console of the Discord client. Inspect elements, that is. They did so by tricking the user saying that doing this can get them unlimited Discord Nitro on their accounts.

Pasting that to the console executes the account token and the hackers asks the user to paste it to their DMs because the claiming part is “too difficult”. Innocent users, not knowing what they shared is their account token, gets their accounts compromised. And with a payment method attached, they can do any in app purchases on your behalf.

You may have seen the huge warning Discord puts when you open Inspect Element on Discord. This is beautiful.

What Do You Do If Your Discord Token Is Compromised?
====================================================

Scammers often attempt to scrape people’s Discord tokens (and bot tokens) to steal servers, bots, and accounts.

They then use these to spam and raid other servers and users. Often, the spam attempts to spread malware that’s designed to steal user credentials and personal information. If you think someone has gained access to your Discord token, you should act immediately.

There are two things that will reset your token and return sole control of your account to you: Changing your Discord password and enabling two-factor authorization (2FA).

*   Open the Discord app or head to Discord via your web browser.
*   By your name, select the gear icon to open Settings.3. Select My Account.
*   Scroll down and select Change Password and enter a secure password.
*   Click done.

**Bonus:** Select 2FA, install Google Authenticator or Authy; next, follow the instructions listed there.
