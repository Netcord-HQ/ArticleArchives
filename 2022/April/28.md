With a great powerful platform like Discord, there must also come great responsibilities.

After a couple of months of owning a Discord Server myself, I’ve learned a lot of things about community building that I would love to share.

Ready? Here are a few of them.

Best Audience Connection
========================

There is no such platform like Discord in terms of your connection with your audience. You get to know one personally, you get to know your audience on a personal level. And in turn, they can have a conversation with you 1 on 1 live.

You also engage with people around the world or even your neighbors. You meet different kinds of people based on their language, country. You even have a chance of making some best friends with them.

**Entrepreneurial Skills**
==========================

Owning a Discord server is very much like owning a business and being the leader of a community and a team (staff). You learn to manage people whether it’s small or big in numbers, you focus on your aim.

You start to think outside the box. Yes, owning a Discord Server is a big hustle but if you think in a positive way you may develop your creativity. Whatever genre your server’s in, you care about expanding the audience and thinking of creating something unique and special for your members.

Responsible Job
===============

You cannot just create a server, grow it and just leave it like that. You have more responsibilities of the members and the safety of them.

This is like a government. Whenever you do something that’s not likely for the members you are going to get a lot of criticism. And dealing with criticism is yet another big lesson you learn along the way.

Dealing with Consequences
=========================

After you’ve built your own audience or members, it’s not only about you and your staff member’s liking on how the server should be, the members’ opinions matter. Just make sure that you are interacting with people’s suggestions. You can set up a simple suggestion system with [Carl Bot](https://carl.gg) or [Sapphire](https://sapph.xyz/).

This is derived from the last point, you make a mistake learn from it and then it continues and it certainly makes you an even more stronger person to face tougher circumstances.

My opinions are that you develop some amazing and useful skills to be a better person that this world wants. Stay positive always.
