How I Retained Level 3 Boost on my Discord Server for 2 years
=============================================================

I have 3 tiers of booster ranks. I could’ve gone with 2 or just 1, but I didn’t. Here’s precisely why.

Let’s get things straight first.

You are going to learn an insane marketing strategy used by large tech companies. We’re going to take that strategy and implement it to Discord. Because humans are humans no matter where we come from. Our brains are wired in such a way.

1–2–3 Strategy
==============

I have 3 tiers of booster ranks. I could’ve gone with 2 or just 1, but I didn’t. And it’s for a pretty good reason actually. Here’s why.

Tier 1: A List of Rewards for people who boost my server once
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is a default Discord server feature. Every Discord server has this automatically managed system where a booster gets a special role. Nothing too special about this. I do have a good amount of perks for 1x boosters.

Tier 2: A List of Rewards for people who boost my server twice
--------------------------------------------------------------

Now why does boosting twice mean so much?

Imagine you win a Nitro giveaway. A regular $10 nitro comes with 2 free server boosts. Now imagine the type of dedication and love someone would have to have for your server that they spend it on you. So that _you_ benefit.

Personally I find it oddly attractive to be so connected to my creation. Every time someone double boosts my Server I am absolutely stunned like “Why, thank you, good sir. You shall stay in my heart.” Here’s some better perks for you.

Tier 3: A List of Rewards for people who boost my server three times or more
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now this is where I draw the line between supporting and simping. Just kidding.

Someone boosting my server three or more times means that they spent actual money on my server. Whereas, in a double or single boost, the boost could’ve been from a giveaway they won. This also means that boosters of this category have a payment method attached. Which means, the boost will last basically forever until they decide to cancel the boost subscription. Unlike in a double or single boost where the boost will expire when their Nitro does.

This opens the door for the money-spenders to unlock very exclusive perks like getting their friend requests accepted by me or a custom animated pet emoji of their logo.

The Way of Listing Rewards
==========================

To think, you are selling a product. People are buying perks by paying you boosts. Here’s how to list the perks and benefits of your Discord boosting.

Strategy 1:
-----------

Give insane perks to single booster to make it worth it for a small price to pay. This way you will get more single boosters but boosts nonetheless. Then add additional perks to higher ranks if you have them. Or it’s also totally fine not to have them.

Strategy 2:
-----------

Give decent perks to 1x, best perks to 2x, and additional to 3x+.  
Make it seem that boosting twice is the option for them. This strategy is also used by Starbucks coffee to subconsciously force you to buy the Venti. (It’s closer to the price of Grande which makes it useless because you get more value in Venti with less dollars to spend.

This could all mean nothing
===========================

Beside my main server, I am also currently the owner of the official [Netcord](https://discord.gg/JjfYGRJ2NN) server. I still don’t have public rewards for boosters. And it’s okay because getting it boosted isn’t the current priority right now. Take from that what you will.

Me making YouTube videos is likely to encourage them to boost so I might be a little too biased to write this article.
