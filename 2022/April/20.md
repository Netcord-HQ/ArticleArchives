Discord, like most online social media, has safety concerns for its users. How should you stay safe? Well, there are multiple features inside of Discord to stay safe from the undesirable people, Let’s cover these and learn together on how to be safe on Discord!

Using a secure password
=======================

In most online websites/apps, Having a secure password is common sense yet it’s rarely used. What makes a secure password?

*   Use one password only once  
    Have unique passwords for all accounts
*   Use series of Numbers, Alphabets, Symbols, and Words
*   Use a mixture of UPPERCASE and lowercase

Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA)
========================================

2FA is 100% recommended to keep your account safe. Enabling it is an easy method to keep your account more secure and less likely to be hacked. How do we do this? Well it’s quite easy.

Head over to your user settings and on the overview page, scroll down a little and we have the option to enable 2FA. All you need is a phone and an Authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy.

Follow the steps and you’ll have your account 10x more secured than it was 10 minutes ago. In case you get stuck, [here’s a guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLPx4jGHzY0) on how to enable it.

Filtering NSFW content in DMs
=============================

Discord has a way to filter all NSFW content from your DMs, so you don’t get random inappropriate media.

Head over to settings > Privacy and Safety > And at the top, you can select the level of filter for NSFW content! It is recommended to have scan direct messages from everyone or just friends.

Closing Your DMs
================

Do you want to completely stop random people from messaging you?

Well, that’s completely possible with Discord and It’s pretty easy! So right under the place to filter NSFW, there is “Allow direct messages from server members” press this so it is grey, and there you are with closed DMs.

This way, the only way people will be able to DM you is by sending you a friend request and you accepting it.

Turning Off Friend Requests
===========================

Do you want to completely remove your friend requests? Are you annoyed by the number of friend requests you get? You can easily turn off friend requests from people so that only you can send someone friend requests.

Directly under the settings of “Allow direct messages from server members” we have “Who can add you as a friend” you can decide which group of these people can add you and which cannot.

1.  **Everyone** — Disabling this completely removes friend requests towards you.
2.  **Friends of Friends** — Only people who have one of your friends added can add you as friend.
3.  **Server Members** — Only people who are in the same server as you are, can add you as friend.

That’s all-hope you enjoyed today’s article. See you tomorrow!
