Why the new Pronouns Discord feature is a disaster
==================================================

Discord seems to be getting a little too sideways with their new features.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Discord data miners have found a new field from the application’s source code. It’s not officially out or even announced yet, but Discord devs are working on it.

But why?

Is it really worth implementing an entire different section in our profiles for pronouns? Personally, it’s useless and unnecessary.

Pronoun Field in Profiles
=========================

“Pronoun Fields” are a separate text field in your profile, titled “PRONOUNS”.

For some, this is everything. “To be able to showcase my pronouns to the community, that’s all I’ve ever wanted!”. While others are facepalming on whether this is going to be the only thing Discord has added without a Nitro requirement.

Why it’s a disaster in its current state
========================================

Discord. My brother in Christ, you added **about me** for this exact reason. To express ourselves, to let us tell _about_ ourselves. Ever since this About Me feature came out a lot of users are using it to state their pronouns already.

I’d approve of this feature if
------------------------------

…they had some form of formatting on the pronouns instead of literally being basic text. Like for example, the pronouns entered can be placed in a box. Like server roles.

This also makes the profile look clumsy. If anything Discord should just increase the character limit on our bios instead.

Why not this instead?
---------------------

I think a lot of people are also using their about me’s to share their portfolio links, discord server links, etc. So it would make sense if they worked on something that’d let us have custom links on our profile.

Because let’s be honest, the profile connections are cool but heavily limited to certain websites only. It’d be super cool if they let us use custom links with custom texts. Kind of like how YouTube does it.

Let’s not jump to a hasty conclusion right away though
======================================================

This feature is not even on the roll out, it’s not announced anywhere.

I just hope the final version of this feature look better than the screenshots.

Anyways, the reddit post was getting so wild, moderators had to lock the thread altogether.
