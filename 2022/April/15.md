How to Structure your Staff Team
================================

It is strange how we operate on the same platform without knowing a thing about each other’s staff structure

Moderation is necessary for every Discord server.

I personally run a 11k Discord server and I have never seen the staff channels of my friends Discord servers and they haven’t seen mine. But who knows what goes under the hood?

How do we form a system so perfect and efficient? We just have to wait long enough to figure it out ourselves. This trial and error method feels kind of a waste of time doesn’t it?

How many Moderators do I need?
==============================

You may have asked yourself this question previously. What’s the answer? It depends on your server activity level. “Doesn’t member count matter?”

My old 100 member server can overtake my new 11,000 server in terms of activity any day. Funny enough, we didn’t even need moderators back then. Because we weren’t a community server. Just a few no life friends talking day and night.

That is why server theme matters more than member count. The amount of members on your server, one way or the other, relates to your activity.

3️⃣ Start with three.
---------------------

I think three is a good place to start. Always remember, just because they’re active in chat doesn’t mean they are good moderators. Demoting someone is more work and trauma. Hire smartly instead. For the first batch, consider getting some of your discord-experienced friends

As your activity starts to grow, and when you get outnumbered, or chat is active in the uncovered part of the time zones, that is when it’s time to get new staff members.

Roles Structure
===============

Here’s my staff team role structure:

*   Admin
*   Moderator
*   Trial Mod
*   Management

Pretty basic right? It does the job. “Management” is the base staff role for all moderatos as a part of them being in the team.

Have an administrator for around every 5 moderators. Unless you chose to have Senior Moderators.

Staff Channels Structure:
=========================

A private **#staff-chat** and **#staff-commands** is necessary.

What’s also worth implementing is a **#staff-guide** handbook so new moderators know exactly how moderation works in your server. Mention in there what violations cause what type of punishment.

A private **#staff-news** channel doesn’t sound like a bummer. You can use it to update moderators on various announcements only staff needs to know.

You can also have a **#staff-suggestions** to let you staff members suggest different things to be implemented into the server.

**Proof of Violation:** A channel for moderators to post the mod action they made against a user. They shall also mention why they punished the user along with a screenshot.

Discord themselves recommend keeping track of mod cases manually.

If you are a server owner, feel free to ask for suggestions or feedback on [**Netcord’s Official Discord**](https://discord.com/invite/JjfYGRJ2NN) server! We’d love to help you out. I was alone when setting mine up, you don’t have to! Thank you for reading — see you tomorrow!
