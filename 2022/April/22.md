I’ve been owning servers for over 2 years now. There have been lots of ups and downs and it’s no surprise that I, too, made some mistakes. Here’s the biggest one I made.

It’s ok.
--------

It is okay. And the first step to getting something done is starting. I learned and grew mentally to be where I am today.

It may sound stupid to some but Discord absolutely changed my life. While it gave me the best ever dopamine shots in my head, also had one of the darkest times here in Discord.

And it’s okay to make mistakes.

A Little Background
===================

I had to leave Discord for a couple of weeks in late Autumn last year. Partially because I wanted to, but also because I had to.

I wanted the break to be permanent. I thought I was done with Discord. Perhaps this sudden “break” would bring me closer to the world around me, I thought. I couldn’t announce my leave because I never knew when I’d come back. Or _if_ I’d come back.

The server was growing rapidly at that time because my YouTube videos had been kicking off. And I made quite a good bit of money out of the sponsorships. But, my OG server friends went quite because of their own reasons. The server felt so big yet so empty.

This tiny 8 week break had been the best time I had in a very long time. I got so many pings and DMs from my staff team and server members. YouTube stats in a decline. Server activity in a decline.

Then I came back
----------------

It was chaos but in a quite way. The majority of the server was suddenly against me. Can’t share too much as to “why” but boy was it a mess to resolve.

After a week of rebranding, I managed to bring it back to a stable state. How did I do it?

Giving Wrong People Authority
=============================

I removed the mole. The reason for the decline in server activity wasn’t because of me. Yeah, maybe some found it annoying that I wasn’t answering their DMs or I was never online. And partially also because the videos blowing up on my channel were bringing in the wrong audience to the server.

But the main reason is because I had the wrong people in authority in reflect to the community. I wanted to foster a healthy non-toxic community.

The co-owner I left in charge wasn’t a co owner because of their authority skills. It’s because of my relationship with them. And they were one of the very few friends to actually stay after the great activity downfall.

I keep saying it but this is true:

> Sometimes you become too walled up in your own little friend circle that you don’t see how you treat the people outside the bubble.

That’s where I went wrong
-------------------------

I had never made such a violent mistake before this one.

**Just because someone is active in your chats does not mean they can be trusted with authority powers.**

Sure someone like my old upper staff team is literally the perfect people for a great laugh in a group chat or a private server.

I guess I wasn’t realizing that it wasn’t the old server anymore. Where it’d be just my friends talking 24/7 in a 100 member server. It turned to something so much bigger than any of us in such a rapid growth.

If I could turn back time, I would do a lot of things differently. Actually, I wouldn’t turn back time at all. I don’t want to re-live the deep mud I was once in.

**It’s a wild story and a limited time to write it. I wish I could stitch the story better than this. I left so many parts out too. Sorry!**

TL;DR
=====

I left Discord for sometime. Server grew big but toxic people in power. Server activity down and toxicity level high.

**Here’s what I want you to take from this article:**  
Knowing someone personally is nice. They know you personally too. What they might not know is how to act around a large audience. And it is your responsibility to act **selflessly** and do what’s right for the larger audience.

Not saying to completely eradicate your comfort but if you can’t take care of this community, don’t make one.
